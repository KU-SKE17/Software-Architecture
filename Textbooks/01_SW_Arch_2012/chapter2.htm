<div class="attri">
<p class="blockquote"><em>Software architecture is the set of design decisions which, if made incorrectly, may cause your project to be cancelled.</em></p>
<p class="attribution">—Eoin Woods</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">If architecture is the answer, what was the question?</p>
<p class="indent">While <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 will cover the business importance of architecture to an enterprise, 
this chapter focuses on why architecture matters from a technical 
perspective. We will examine a baker’s dozen of the most important 
reasons.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> An architecture will inhibit or enable a system’s driving quality attributes.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> The decisions made in an architecture allow you to reason about and manage change as the system evolves.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> The analysis of an architecture enables early prediction of a system’s qualities.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> A documented architecture enhances communication among stakeholders.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> The architecture is a carrier of the earliest and hence most fundamental, hardest-to-change design decisions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>6.</strong> An architecture defines a set of constraints on subsequent implementation.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>7.</strong> The architecture dictates the structure of an organization, or vice versa.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>8.</strong> An architecture can provide the basis for evolutionary prototyping.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>9.</strong> An architecture is the key artifact that allows the architect and project manager to reason about cost and schedule.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>10.</strong> An architecture can be created as a transferable, reusable model that forms the heart of a product line.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>11.</strong> Architecture-based development focuses attention on the assembly of components, rather than simply on their creation.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>12.</strong> By restricting design alternatives, architecture channels the creativity of developers, reducing design and system complexity.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>13.</strong> An architecture can be the foundation for training a new team member.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_26"></a>Even if you already believe us 
that architecture is important and don’t need the point hammered 
thirteen more times, think of these thirteen points (which form the 
outline for this chapter) as thirteen useful ways to use architecture in
 a project.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec1">2.1. Inhibiting or Enabling a System’s Quality Attributes</h3>
<p class="noindent">Whether a system will be able to exhibit its desired
 (or required) quality attributes is substantially determined by its 
architecture.</p>
<p class="indent">This is such an important message that we’ve devoted all of <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/part02.html#part02">Part 2</a> of this book to expounding that message in detail. Until then, keep these examples in mind as a starting point:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• If your system requires high performance, 
then you need to pay attention to managing the time-based behavior of 
elements, their use of shared resources, and the frequency and volume of
 inter-element communication.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• If modifiability is important, then you need
 to pay careful attention to assigning responsibilities to elements so 
that the majority of changes to the system will affect a small number of
 those elements. (Ideally each change will affect just a single 
element.)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• If your system must be highly secure, then 
you need to manage and protect inter-element communication and control 
which elements are allowed to access which information; you may also 
need to introduce specialized elements (such as an authorization 
mechanism) into the architecture.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• If you believe that scalability will be 
important to the success of your system, then you need to carefully 
localize the use of resources to facilitate introduction of 
higher-capacity replacements, and you must avoid hard-coding in resource
 assumptions or limits.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• If your projects need the ability to deliver
 incremental subsets of the system, then you must carefully manage 
intercomponent usage.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• If you want the elements from your system to
 be reusable in other systems, then you need to restrict inter-element 
coupling, so that when you extract an element, it does not come out with
 too many attachments to its current environment to be useful.</p>
<p class="indent">The strategies for these and other quality attributes 
are supremely architectural. But an architecture alone cannot guarantee 
the functionality or quality required of a system. Poor downstream 
design or implementation decisions can always undermine an adequate 
architectural design. As we like to say (<em>mostly</em> in jest): The 
architecture giveth and the implementation taketh away. Decisions at all
 stages of the life cycle—from architectural design to coding and 
implementation—affect system quality. Therefore, quality is not 
completely a function of an architectural design.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_27"></a>A good architecture is necessary, 
but not sufficient, to ensure quality. Achieving quality attributes must
 be considered throughout design, implementation, and deployment. No 
quality attribute is entirely dependent on design, nor is it entirely 
dependent on implementation or deployment. Satisfactory results are a 
matter of getting the big picture (architecture) as well as the details 
(implementation) correct.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, modifiability is determined by how 
functionality is divided and coupled (architectural) and by coding 
techniques within a module (nonarchitectural). Thus, a system is 
typically modifiable if changes involve the fewest possible number of 
distinct elements. In spite of having the ideal architecture, however, 
it is always possible to make a system difficult to modify by writing 
obscure, tangled code.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec2">2.2. Reasoning About and Managing Change</h3>
<p class="noindent">This point is a corollary to the previous point.</p>
<p class="indent">Modifiability—the ease with which changes can be made 
to a system—is a quality attribute (and hence covered by the arguments 
in the previous section), but it is such an important quality that we 
have awarded it its own spot in the List of Thirteen. The software 
development community is coming to grips with the fact that roughly 80 
percent of a typical software system’s total cost occurs <em>after</em> 
initial deployment. A corollary of this statistic is that most systems 
that people work on are in this phase. Many programmers and software 
designers <em>never</em> get to work on new development; they work under
 the constraints of the existing architecture and the existing body of 
code. Virtually all software systems change over their lifetime, to 
accommodate new features, to adapt to new environments, to fix bugs, and
 so forth. But these changes are often fraught with difficulty.</p>
<p class="indent">Every architecture partitions possible changes into three categories: local, nonlocal, and architectural.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• A local change can be accomplished by 
modifying a single element. For example, adding a new business rule to a
 pricing logic module.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• A nonlocal change requires multiple element 
modifications but leaves the underlying architectural approach intact. 
For example, adding a new business rule to a pricing logic module, then 
adding new fields to the database that this new business rule requires, 
and then revealing the results of the rule in the user interface.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• An architectural change affects the 
fundamental ways in which the elements interact with each other and will
 probably require changes all over the system. For example, changing a 
system from client-server to peer-to-peer.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_28"></a>Obviously, local changes are the most desirable, and so an <em>effective</em> architecture is one in which the most common changes are local, and hence easy to make.</p>
<p class="indent">Deciding when changes are essential, determining which
 change paths have the least risk, assessing the consequences of 
proposed changes, and arbitrating sequences and priorities for requested
 changes all require broad insight into relationships, performance, and 
behaviors of system software elements. These activities are in the job 
description for an architect. Reasoning about the architecture and 
analyzing the architecture can provide the insight necessary to make 
decisions about anticipated changes.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec3">2.3. Predicting System Qualities</h3>
<p class="noindent">This point follows from the previous two. 
Architecture not only imbues systems with qualities, but it does so in a
 predictable way.</p>
<p class="indent">Were it not possible to tell that the appropriate 
architectural decisions have been made (i.e., if the system will exhibit
 its required quality attributes) without waiting until the system is 
developed and deployed, then choosing an architecture would be a 
hopeless task—randomly making architecture selections would perform as 
well as any other method. Fortunately, it <em>is</em> possible to make 
quality predictions about a system based solely on an evaluation of its 
architecture. If we know that certain kinds of architectural decisions 
lead to certain quality attributes in a system, then we can make those 
decisions and rightly expect to be rewarded with the associated quality 
attributes. After the fact, when we examine an architecture, we can look
 to see if those decisions have been made, and confidently predict that 
the architecture will exhibit the associated qualities.</p>
<p class="indent">This is no different from any mature engineering 
discipline, where design analysis is a standard part of the development 
process. The earlier you can find a problem in your design, the cheaper,
 easier, and less disruptive it will be to fix.</p>
<p class="indent">Even if you don’t do the quantitative analytic 
modeling sometimes necessary to ensure that an architecture will deliver
 its prescribed benefits, this principle of evaluating decisions based 
on their quality attribute implications is invaluable for at least 
spotting potential trouble spots early.</p>
<p class="indent">The architecture modeling and analysis techniques described in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</a>, as well as the architecture evaluation techniques covered in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch21.html#ch21">Chapter 21</a>, allow early insight into the software product qualities made possible by software architectures.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec4"><a id="page_29"></a>2.4. Enhancing Communication among Stakeholders</h3>
<p class="indent">Software architecture represents a common abstraction 
of a system that most, if not all, of the system’s stakeholders can use 
as a basis for creating mutual understanding, negotiating, forming 
consensus, and communicating with each other. The architecture—or at 
least parts of it—is sufficiently abstract that most nontechnical people
 can understand it adequately, particularly with some coaching from the 
architect, and yet that abstraction can be refined into sufficiently 
rich technical specifications to guide implementation, integration, 
test, and deployment.</p>
<p class="indent">Each stakeholder of a software system—customer, user, 
project manager, coder, tester, and so on—is concerned with different 
characteristics of the system that are affected by its architecture. For
 example:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The user is concerned that the system is fast, reliable, and available when needed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The customer is concerned that the architecture can be implemented on schedule and according to budget.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The manager is worried (in addition to 
concerns about cost and schedule) that the architecture will allow teams
 to work largely independently, interacting in disciplined and 
controlled ways.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The architect is worried about strategies to achieve all of those goals.</p>
<p class="indent">Architecture provides a common language in which 
different concerns can be expressed, negotiated, and resolved at a level
 that is intellectually manageable even for large, complex systems. 
Without such a language, it is difficult to understand large systems 
sufficiently to make the early decisions that influence both quality and
 usefulness. Architectural analysis, as we will see in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch21.html#ch21">Chapter 21</a>, both depends on this level of communication and enhances it.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch03.html#ch03lev1sec5">Section 3.5</a> covers stakeholders and their concerns in greater depth.</p>
<div class="sidebar"><hr>
<p class="title"><a id="ch02sb01"></a>“What Happens When I Push This Button?” Architecture as a Vehicle for Stakeholder Communication</p>
<p class="sb-noindent">The project review droned on and on. The 
government-sponsored development was behind schedule and over budget and
 was large enough that these lapses were attracting congressional 
attention. And now the government was making up for past neglect by 
holding a marathon come-one-come-all review session. The contractor had 
recently undergone a buyout, which hadn’t helped matters. It was the 
afternoon of the second day, and the agenda called for the software 
architecture to be presented. The young architect—an apprentice to the 
chief architect for the system—was bravely explaining how the software 
architecture for the massive system would enable it to meet its very 
demanding real-time, distributed, high-reliability <a id="page_30"></a>requirements.
 He had a solid presentation and a solid architecture to present. It was
 sound and sensible. But the audience—about 30 government 
representatives who had varying roles in the management and oversight of
 this sticky project—was tired. Some of them were even thinking that 
perhaps they should have gone into real estate instead of enduring 
another one of these marathon let’s-finally-get-it-right-this-time 
reviews.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The viewgraph showed, in semiformal box-and-line 
notation, what the major software elements were in a runtime view of the
 system. The names were all acronyms, suggesting no semantic meaning 
without explanation, which the young architect gave. The lines showed 
data flow, message passing, and process synchronization. The elements 
were internally redundant, the architect was explaining. “In the event 
of a failure,” he began, using a laser pointer to denote one of the 
lines, “a restart mechanism triggers along this path when—”</p>
<p class="sb-indent">“What happens when the mode select button is 
pushed?” interrupted one of the audience members. He was a government 
attendee representing the user community for this system.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">“Beg your pardon?” asked the architect.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">“The mode select button,” he said. “What happens when you push it?”</p>
<p class="sb-indent">“Um, that triggers an event in the device driver, 
up here,” began the architect, laser-pointing. “It then reads the 
register and interprets the event code. If it’s mode select, well, then,
 it signals the blackboard, which in turns signals the objects that have
 subscribed to that event. . . .”</p>
<p class="sb-indent">“No, I mean what does the system <em>do,</em>” interrupted the questioner. “Does it reset the displays? And what happens if this occurs during a system reconfiguration?”</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The architect looked a little surprised and flicked
 off the laser pointer. This was not an architectural question, but 
since he was an architect and therefore fluent in the requirements, he 
knew the answer. “If the command line is in setup mode, the displays 
will reset,” he said. “Otherwise an error message will be put on the 
control console, but the signal will be ignored.” He put the laser 
pointer back on. “Now, the restart mechanism that I was talking about—”</p>
<p class="sb-indent">“Well, I was just wondering,” said the users’ 
delegate. “Because I see from your chart that the display console is 
sending signal traffic to the target location module.”</p>
<p class="sb-indent">“What <em>should</em> happen?” asked another member
 of the audience, addressing the first questioner. “Do you really want 
the user to get mode data during its reconfiguring?” And for the next 45
 minutes, the architect watched as the audience consumed his time slot 
by debating what the correct behavior of the system was supposed to be 
in various esoteric states.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The debate was not architectural, but the 
architecture (and the graphical rendition of it) had sparked debate. It 
is natural to think of architecture as the basis for communication among
 some of the stakeholders besides the architects and developers: 
Managers, for example, use the architecture to create teams and allocate
 resources among them. But users? The architecture is invisible to 
users, after all; why should they latch on to it as a tool for 
understanding the system?</p>
<p class="sb-indent"><a id="page_31"></a>The fact is that they do. In 
this case, the questioner had sat through two days of viewgraphs all 
about function, operation, user interface, and testing. But it was the 
first slide on architecture that—even though he was tired and wanted to 
go home—made him realize he didn’t understand something. Attendance at 
many architecture reviews has convinced me that seeing the system in a 
new way prods the mind and brings new questions to the surface. For 
users, architecture often serves as that new way, and the questions that
 a user poses will be behavioral in nature. In a memorable architecture 
evaluation exercise a few years ago, the user representatives were much 
more interested in what the system was going to do than in how it was 
going to do it, and naturally so. Up until that point, their only 
contact with the vendor had been through its marketers. The architect 
was the first legitimate expert on the system to whom they had access, 
and they didn’t hesitate to seize the moment.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Of course, careful and thorough requirements 
specifications would ameliorate this situation, but for a variety of 
reasons they are not always created or available. In their absence, a 
specification of the architecture often serves to trigger questions and 
improve clarity. It is probably more prudent to recognize this reality 
than to resist it.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Sometimes such an exercise will reveal unreasonable
 requirements, whose utility can then be revisited. A review of this 
type that emphasizes synergy between requirements and architecture would
 have let the young architect in our story off the hook by giving him a 
place in the overall review session to address that kind of information.
 And the user representative wouldn’t have felt like a fish out of 
water, asking his question at a clearly inappropriate moment.</p>

<h3 id="ch02lev1sec5">2.5. Carrying Early Design Decisions</h3>
<p class="noindent">Software architecture is a manifestation of the 
earliest design decisions about a system, and these early bindings carry
 enormous weight with respect to the system’s remaining development, its
 deployment, and its maintenance life. It is also the earliest point at 
which these important design decisions affecting the system can be 
scrutinized.</p>
<p class="indent">Any design, in any discipline, can be viewed as a set 
of decisions. When painting a picture, an artist decides on the material
 for the canvas, on the media for recording—oil paint, watercolor, 
crayon—even before the picture is begun. Once the picture is begun, 
other decisions are immediately made: Where is the first line? What is 
its thickness? What is its shape? All of these early design decisions 
have a strong influence on the final appearance of the picture. Each 
decision constrains the many decisions that follow. Each decision, in 
isolation, might appear innocent enough, but the early ones in 
particular have disproportionate weight simply because they influence 
and constrain so much of what follows.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_32"></a>So it is with architecture design.
 An architecture design can also be viewed as a set of decisions. The 
early design decisions constrain the decisions that follow, and changing
 these decisions has enormous ramifications. Changing these early 
decisions will cause a ripple effect, in terms of the additional 
decisions that must now be changed. Yes, sometimes the architecture must
 be refactored or redesigned, but this is not a task we undertake 
lightly (because the “ripple” might turn into a tsunami).</p>
<p class="indent">What are these early design decisions embodied by software architecture? Consider:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Will the system run on one processor or be distributed across multiple processors?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Will the software be layered? If so, how many layers will there be? What will each one do?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Will components communicate synchronously or asynchronously? Will they interact by transferring control or data or both?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Will the system depend on specific features of the operating system or hardware?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Will the information that flows through the system be encrypted or not?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• What operating system will we use?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• What communication protocol will we choose?</p>
<p class="indent">Imagine the nightmare of having to change any of these
 or a myriad other related decisions. Decisions like these begin to 
flesh out some of the structures of the architecture and their 
interactions. In <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>, we describe seven categories of these early design decisions. In <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch05.html#ch05">Chapters 5</a>–<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch11.html#ch11">11</a> we show the implications of these design decision categories on achieving quality attributes.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec6">2.6. Defining Constraints on an Implementation</h3>
<p class="noindent">An implementation exhibits an architecture if it 
conforms to the design decisions prescribed by the architecture. This 
means that the implementation must be implemented as the set of 
prescribed elements, these elements must interact with each other in the
 prescribed fashion, and each element must fulfill its responsibility to
 the other elements as dictated by the architecture. Each of these 
prescriptions is a constraint on the implementer.</p>
<p class="indent">Element builders must be fluent in the specifications 
of their individual elements, but they may not be aware of the 
architectural tradeoffs—the architecture (or architect) simply 
constrains them in such a way as to meet the tradeoffs. A classic 
example of this phenomenon is when an architect assigns performance 
budget to the pieces of software involved in some larger piece of 
functionality. If each software unit stays within its budget, the 
overall transaction will meet its <a id="page_33"></a>performance requirement. Implementers of each of the constituent pieces may not know the overall budget, only their own.</p>
<p class="indent">Conversely, the architects need not be experts in all 
aspects of algorithm design or the intricacies of the programming 
language—although they should certainly know enough not to design 
something that is difficult to build—but they are the ones responsible 
for establishing, analyzing, and enforcing the architectural tradeoffs.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec7">2.7. Influencing the Organizational Structure</h3>
<p class="noindent">Not only does architecture prescribe the structure 
of the system being developed, but that structure becomes engraved in 
the structure of the development project (and sometimes the structure of
 the entire organization). The normal method for dividing up the labor 
in a large project is to assign different groups different portions of 
the system to construct. This is called the work-breakdown structure of a
 system. Because the architecture includes the broadest decomposition of
 the system, it is typically used as the basis for the work-breakdown 
structure. The work-breakdown structure in turn dictates units of 
planning, scheduling, and budget; interteam communication channels; 
configuration control and file-system organization; integration and test
 plans and procedures; and even project minutiae such as how the project
 intranet is organized and who sits with whom at the company picnic. 
Teams communicate with each other in terms of the interface 
specifications for the major elements. The maintenance activity, when 
launched, will also reflect the software structure, with teams formed to
 maintain specific structural elements from the architecture: the 
database, the business rules, the user interface, the device drivers, 
and so forth.</p>
<p class="indent">A side effect of establishing the work-breakdown 
structure is to freeze some aspects of the software architecture. A 
group that is responsible for one of the subsystems will resist having 
its responsibilities distributed across other groups. If these 
responsibilities have been formalized in a contractual relationship, 
changing responsibilities could become expensive or even litigious.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, once the architecture has been agreed on, it 
becomes very costly—for managerial and business reasons—to significantly
 modify it. This is one argument (among many) for carrying out extensive
 analysis before settling on the software architecture for a large 
system—because so much depends on it.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec8">2.8. Enabling Evolutionary Prototyping</h3>
<p class="noindent">Once an architecture has been defined, it can be 
analyzed and prototyped as a skeletal system. A skeletal system is one 
in which at least some of the <a id="page_34"></a>infrastructure—how the
 elements initialize, communicate, share data, access resources, report 
errors, log activity, and so forth—is built before much of the system’s 
functionality has been created. (The two can go hand in hand: build a 
little infrastructure to support a little end-to-end functionality; 
repeat until done.)</p>
<p class="indent">For example, systems built as plug-in architectures 
are skeletal systems: the plug-ins provide the actual functionality. 
This approach aids the development process because the system is 
executable early in the product’s life cycle. The fidelity of the system
 increases as stubs are instantiated, or prototype parts are replaced 
with complete versions of these parts of the software. In some cases the
 prototype parts can be low-fidelity versions of the final 
functionality, or they can be <em>surrogates</em> that consume and 
produce data at the appropriate rates but do little else. Among other 
things, this approach allows potential performance problems to be 
identified early in the product’s life cycle.</p>
<p class="indent">These benefits reduce the potential risk in the 
project. Furthermore, if the architecture is part of a family of related
 systems, the cost of creating a framework for prototyping can be 
distributed over the development of many systems.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec9">2.9. Improving Cost and Schedule Estimates</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cost and schedule estimates are important tools for 
the project manager both to acquire the necessary resources and to 
monitor progress on the project, to know if and when a project is in 
trouble. One of the duties of an architect is to help the project 
manager create cost and schedule estimates early in the project life 
cycle. Although top-down estimates are useful for setting goals and 
apportioning budgets, cost estimations that are based on a bottom-up 
understanding of the system’s pieces are typically more accurate than 
those that are based purely on top-down system knowledge.</p>
<p class="indent">As we have said, the organizational and work-breakdown
 structure of a project is almost always based on its architecture. Each
 team or individual responsible for a work item will be able to make 
more-accurate estimates for their piece than a project manager and will 
feel more ownership in making the estimates come true. But the best cost
 and schedule estimates will typically emerge from a consensus between 
the top-down estimates (created by the architect and project manager) 
and the bottom-up estimates (created by the developers). The discussion 
and negotiation that results from this process creates a far more 
accurate estimate than either approach by itself.</p>
<p class="indent">It helps if the requirements for a system have been 
reviewed and validated. The more up-front knowledge you have about the 
scope, the more accurate the cost and schedule estimates will be.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch22.html#ch22">Chapter 22</a> delves into the use of architecture in project management.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec10"><a id="page_35"></a>2.10. Supplying a Transferable, Reusable Model</h3>
<p class="noindent">The earlier in the life cycle that reuse is applied,
 the greater the benefit that can be achieved. While code reuse provides
 a benefit, reuse of architectures provides tremendous leverage for 
systems with similar requirements. Not only can code be reused, but so 
can the requirements that led to the architecture in the first place, as
 well as the experience and infrastructure gained in building the reused
 architecture. When architectural decisions can be reused across 
multiple systems, all of the early-decision consequences we just 
described are also transferred.</p>
<p class="indent">A software product line or family is a set of software
 systems that are all built using the same set of reusable assets. Chief
 among these assets is the architecture that was designed to handle the 
needs of the entire family. Product-line architects choose an 
architecture (or a family of closely related architectures) that will 
serve all envisioned members of the product line. The architecture 
defines what is fixed for all members of the product line and what is 
variable. Software product lines represent a powerful approach to 
multi-system development that is showing order-of-magnitude payoffs in 
time to market, cost, productivity, and product quality. The power of 
architecture lies at the heart of the paradigm. Similar to other capital
 investments, the architecture for a product line becomes a developing 
organization’s core asset. Software product lines are explained in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch25.html#ch25">Chapter 25</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec11">2.11. Allowing Incorporation of Independently Developed Components</h3>
<p class="noindent">Whereas earlier software paradigms have focused on <em>programming</em> as the prime activity, with progress measured in lines of code, architecture-based development often focuses on <em>composing</em> or <em>assembling elements</em>
 that are likely to have been developed separately, even independently, 
from each other. This composition is possible because the architecture 
defines the elements that can be incorporated into the system. The 
architecture constrains possible replacements (or additions) according 
to how they interact with their environment, how they receive and 
relinquish control, what data they consume and produce, how they access 
data, and what protocols they use for communication and resource 
sharing.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1793, Eli Whitney’s mass production of muskets, 
based on the principle of interchangeable parts, signaled the dawn of 
the industrial age. In the days before physical measurements were 
reliable, manufacturing interchangeable parts was a daunting notion. 
Today in software, until abstractions can be reliably delimited, the 
notion of structural interchangeability is just as daunting and just as 
significant.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_36"></a>Commercial off-the-shelf 
components, open source software, publicly available apps, and networked
 services are all modern-day software instantiations of Whitney’s basic 
idea. Whitney’s musket parts had “interfaces” (having to do with fit and
 durability) and so do today’s interchangeable software components.</p>
<p class="indent">For software, the payoff can be</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Decreased time to market (it should be easier to use someone else’s ready solution than build your own)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Increased reliability (widely used software should have its bugs ironed out already)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Lower cost (the software supplier can amortize development cost across their customer base)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Flexibility (if the component you want to 
buy is not terribly special-purpose, it’s likely to be available from 
several sources, thus increasing your buying leverage)</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec12">2.12. Restricting the Vocabulary of Design Alternatives</h3>
<p class="noindent">As useful architectural patterns are collected, it 
becomes clear that although software elements can be combined in more or
 less infinite ways, there is something to be gained by voluntarily 
restricting ourselves to a relatively small number of choices of 
elements and their interactions. By doing so we minimize the design 
complexity of the system we are building.</p>
<p class="indent">A software engineer is not an <em>artiste</em>, whose creativity and freedom are paramount. Engineering is about discipline, and discipline comes in part by <em>restricting</em>
 the vocabulary of alternatives to proven solutions. Advantages of this 
approach include enhanced reuse, more regular and simpler designs that 
are more easily understood and communicated, more capable analysis, 
shorter selection time, and greater interoperability. Architectural 
patterns guide the architect and focus the architect on the quality 
attributes of interest in large part by restricting the vocabulary of 
design alternatives to a relatively small number.</p>
<p class="indent">Properties of software design follow from the choice 
of an architectural pattern. Those patterns that are more desirable for a
 particular problem should improve the implementation of the resulting 
design solution, perhaps by making it easier to arbitrate conflicting 
design constraints, by increasing insight into poorly understood design 
contexts, or by helping to surface inconsistencies in requirements. We 
will discuss architectural patterns in more detail in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch13.html#ch13">Chapter 13</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec13"><a id="page_37"></a>2.13. Providing a Basis for Training</h3>
<p class="noindent">The architecture, including a description of how the
 elements interact with each other to carry out the required behavior, 
can serve as the first introduction to the system for new project 
members. This reinforces our point that one of the important uses of 
software architecture is to support and encourage communication among 
the various stakeholders. The architecture is a common reference point.</p>
<p class="indent">Module views are excellent for showing someone the 
structure of a project: Who does what, which teams are assigned to which
 parts of the system, and so forth. Component-and-connector views are 
excellent for explaining how the system is expected to work and 
accomplish its job.</p>
<p class="indent">We will discuss these views in more detail in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch18.html#ch18">Chapter 18</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec14">2.14. Summary</h3>

<h3 id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_38"></a>2.15. For Further Reading</h3>
<p class="noindent">Rebecca Grinter has observed architects from a sociological standpoint. In <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/app01.html#bib01_081">[Grinter 99]</a>
 she argues eloquently that the architect’s primary role is to 
facilitate stakeholder communication. The way she puts it is that 
architects enable communication among parties who would otherwise not be
 able to talk to each other.</p>
<p class="indent">The granddaddy of papers about architecture and organization is <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/app01.html#bib01_055">[Conway 68]</a>.
 Conway’s law states that “organizations which design systems. . . are 
constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication 
structures of these organizations.”</p>
<p class="indent">There is much about software development through 
composition that remains unresolved. When the components that are 
candidates for importation and reuse are distinct subsystems that have 
been built with conflicting architectural assumptions, unanticipated 
complications can increase the effort required to integrate their 
functions. David Garlan and his colleagues coined the term <em>architectural mismatch</em> to describe this situation, and their paper on it is worth reading <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/app01.html#bib01_075">[Garlan 95]</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Paulish <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/app01.html#bib01_159">[Paulish 02]</a>
 discusses architecture-based project management, and in particular the 
ways in which an architecture can help in the estimation of project cost
 and schedule.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec16">2.16. Discussion Questions</h3>
<p class="question"><strong>1.</strong> For each of the thirteen reasons
 articulated in this chapter why architecture is important, take the 
contrarian position: Propose a set of circumstances under which 
architecture is not necessary to achieve the result indicated. Justify 
your position. (Try to come up with different circumstances for each of 
the thirteen.)</p>
<p class="question"><strong>2.</strong> This chapter argues that 
architecture brings a number of tangible benefits. How would you measure
 the benefits, on a particular project, of each of the thirteen points?</p>
<p class="question"><strong>3.</strong> Suppose you want to introduce 
architecture-centric practices to your organization. Your management is 
open to the idea, but wants to know the ROI for doing so. How would you 
respond?</p>
<p class="question"><strong>4.</strong> Prioritize the list of thirteen 
points in this chapter according to some criteria meaningful to you. 
Justify your answer. Or, if you could choose only two or three of the 
reasons to promote the use of architecture in a project, which would you
 choose and why?</p>
