<div id="sbo-rt-content"><div class="annotator-wrapper"><h2 id="ch03"><a id="page_39"></a>3. The Many Contexts of Software Architecture</h2>
<div class="attri">
<p class="blockquote"><em>People in London think of London as the center
 of the world, whereas New Yorkers think the world ends three miles 
outside of Manhattan.</em></p>
<p class="attribution">—Toby Young</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">In 1976, a <em>New Yorker</em> magazine cover 
featured a cartoon by Saul Steinberg showing a New Yorker’s view of the 
world. You’ve probably seen it; if not, you can easily find it online. 
Looking to the west from 9th Avenue in Manhattan, the illustration shows
 10th Avenue, then the wide Hudson River, then a thin strip of 
completely nondescript land called “Jersey,” followed by a somewhat 
thicker strip of land representing the entire rest of the United States.
 The mostly empty United States has a cartoon mountain or two here and 
there and a few cities haphazardly placed “out there,” and is flanked by
 featureless “Canada” on the right and “Mexico” on the left. Beyond is 
the Pacific Ocean, only slightly wider than the Hudson, and beyond that 
lie tiny amorphous shapes for Japan and China and Russia, and that’s 
pretty much the world from a New Yorker’s perspective.</p>
<p class="indent">In a book about architecture, it is tempting to view 
architecture in the same way, as the most important piece of the 
software universe. And in some chapters, we unapologetically will do 
exactly that. But in this chapter we put software architecture in its 
place, showing how it supports and is informed by other critical forces 
and activities in the various contexts in which it plays a role.</p>
<p class="indent">These contexts, around which we structured this book, are as follows:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>Technical.</em> What technical role does the software architecture play in the system or systems of which it’s a part?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>Project life cycle.</em> How does a software architecture relate to the other phases of a software development life cycle?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>Business.</em> How does the presence of a software architecture affect an organization’s business environment?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_40"></a>• <em>Professional.</em> What is the role of a software architect in an organization or a development project?</p>
<p class="noindent">These contexts all play out throughout the book, but
 this chapter introduces each one. Although the contexts are unchanging,
 the specifics for your system may change over time. One challenge for 
the architect is to envision what in their context might change and to 
adopt mechanisms to protect the system and its development if the 
envisioned changes come to pass.</p>
<h3 id="ch03lev1sec1">3.1. Architecture in a Technical Context</h3>
<p class="noindent">Architectures inhibit or enable the achievement of 
quality attributes, and one use of an architecture is to support 
reasoning about the consequences of change in the particular quality 
attributes important for a system at its inception.</p>
<h4 id="ch03lev2sec1">Architectures Inhibit or Enable the Achievement of Quality Attributes</h4>
<p class="noindent"><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 listed thirteen reasons why software architecture is important and 
merits study. Several of those reasons deal with exigencies that go 
beyond the bounds of a particular development project (such as 
communication among stakeholders, many of whom may reside outside the 
project’s organization). Others deal with nontechnical aspects of a 
project (such as the architecture’s influence on a project’s team 
structure, or its contribution to accurate budget and schedule 
estimation). The first three reasons in that List of Thirteen deal 
specifically with an architecture’s technical impact on every system 
that uses it:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> An architecture will inhibit or enable the achievement of a system’s quality attributes.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> You can predict many aspects of a system’s qualities by studying its architecture.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> An architecture makes it easier for you to reason about and manage change.</p>
<p class="indent">These are all about the architecture’s effect on a 
system’s quality attributes, although the first one states it the most 
explicitly. While all of the reasons enumerated in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 are valid statements of the contribution of architecture, probably the 
most important reason that it warrants attention is its critical effect 
on quality attributes.</p>
<p class="indent">This is such a critical point that, with your indulgence, we’ll add a few more points to the bullet list that we gave in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch02.html#ch02lev1sec1">Section 2.1</a>. Remember? The one that started like this:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_41"></a>• If your system requires 
high performance, then you need to pay attention to managing the 
time-based behavior of elements, their use of shared resources, and the 
frequency and volume of interelement communication.</p>
<p class="indenthangingBP">To that list, we’ll add the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• If you care about a system’s availability, you <em>have</em> to be concerned with how components take over for each other in the event of a failure, and how the system responds to a fault.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• If you care about usability, you <em>have</em>
 to be concerned about isolating the details of the user interface and 
those elements responsible for the user experience from the rest of the 
system, so that those things can be tailored and improved over time.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• If you care about the testability of your system, you <em>have</em>
 to be concerned about the testability of individual elements, which 
means making their state observable and controllable, plus understanding
 the emergent behavior of the elements working together.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• If you care about the safety of your system, you <em>have</em> to be concerned about the behavioral envelope of the elements and the emergent behavior of the elements working in concert.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• If you care about interoperability between your system and another, you <em>have</em> to be concerned about which elements are responsible for external interactions so that you can control those interactions.</p>
<p class="indent">These and other representations are all saying the same thing in different ways: If you care about <em>this</em> quality attribute, you have to be concerned with <em>these</em>
 decisions, all of which are thoroughly architectural in nature. An 
architecture inhibits or enables a system’s quality attributes. And 
conversely, nothing else influences an architecture more than the 
quality attribute requirements it must satisfy.</p>
<p class="indent">If you care about architecture for no other reason, 
you should care about it for this one. We feel so strongly about 
architecture’s importance with respect to achieving system quality 
attributes that all of <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/part02.html#part02">Part II</a> of this book is devoted to the topic.</p>
<p class="indent">Why is functionality missing from the preceding list? 
It is missing because the architecture mainly provides containers into 
which the architect places functionality. Functionality is not so much a
 driver for the architecture as it is a consequence of it. We return to 
this point in more detail in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/part02.html#part02">Part II</a>.</p>
<h4 id="ch03lev2sec2">Architectures and the Technical Environment</h4>
<p class="noindent">The technical environment that is current when an 
architecture is designed will influence that architecture. It might 
include standard industry practices or software engineering techniques 
prevalent in the architect’s professional community. It is a brave 
architect who, in today’s environment, does not at least consider a 
web-based, object-oriented, service-oriented, mobility-aware, 
cloud-based, <a id="page_42"></a>social-networking-friendly design for 
an information system. It wasn’t always so, and it won’t be so ten years
 from now when another crop of technological trends has come to the 
fore.</p>
<div class="sidebar"><hr>
<p class="title"><a id="ch03sb01"></a>The Swedish Ship <em>Vasa</em></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">In the 1620s, Sweden and Poland were at war. The 
king of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus, was determined to put a swift and 
favorable end to it and commissioned a new warship the likes of which 
had never been seen before. The <em>Vasa</em>, shown in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch03.html#ch03fig01">Figure 3.1</a>,
 was to be the world’s most formidable instrument of war: 70 meters 
long, able to carry 300 soldiers, and with an astonishing 64 heavy guns 
mounted on two gun decks. Seeking to add overwhelming firepower to his 
navy to strike a decisive blow, the king insisted on stretching the <em>Vasa</em>’s
 armaments to the limits. Her architect, Henrik Hybertsson, was a 
seasoned Dutch shipbuilder with an impeccable reputation, but the <em>Vasa</em> was beyond even his broad experience. Two-gun-deck ships were rare, and none had been built of the <em>Vasa</em>’s size and armament.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch03fig01"></a><img data-mfp-src="/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/graphics/03fig01.jpg" src="Chapter3_files/03fig01.jpg" alt="Image" height="355" width="650"></div>
<p class="fig-caption">Figure 3.1. The warship. Used with permission of The Vasa Museum, Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Like all architects of systems that push the 
envelope of experience, Hybertsson had to balance many concerns. Swift 
time to deployment was critical, but so were performance, functionality,
 safety, reliability, and cost. <a id="page_43"></a>He was also 
responsible to a variety of stakeholders. In this case, the primary 
customer was the king, but Hybertsson also was responsible to the crew 
that would sail his creation. Also like all architects, Hybertsson 
brought his experience with him to the task. In this case, his 
experience told him to design the <em>Vasa</em> as though it were a 
single-gun-deck ship and then extrapolate, which was in accordance with 
the technical environment of the day. Faced with an impossible task, 
Hybertsson had the good sense to die about a year before the ship was 
finished.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The project was completed to his specifications, 
however, and on Sunday morning, August 10, 1628, the mighty ship was 
ready. She set her sails, waddled out into Stockholm’s deep-water 
harbor, fired her guns in salute, and promptly rolled over. Water poured
 in through the open gun ports, and the <em>Vasa</em> plummeted. A few 
minutes later her first and only voyage ended 30 meters beneath the 
surface. Dozens among her 150-man crew drowned.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Inquiries followed, which concluded that the ship 
was well built but “badly proportioned.” In other words, its 
architecture was flawed. Today we know that Hybertsson did a poor job of
 balancing all of the conflicting constraints levied on him. In 
particular, he did a poor job of risk management and a poor job of 
customer management (not that anyone could have fared better). He simply
 acquiesced in the face of impossible requirements.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The story of the <em>Vasa</em>, although more than 
375 years old, well illustrates the Architecture Influence Cycle: 
organization goals beget requirements, which beget an architecture, 
which begets a system. The architecture flows from the architect’s 
experience and the technical environment of the day. Hybertsson suffered
 from the fact that neither of those were up to the task before him.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">In this book, we provide three things that Hybertsson could have used:</p>
<p class="indenthangingNaa"><strong>1.</strong> Examples of successful 
architectural practices that work under demanding requirements, so as to
 help set the technical playing field of the day.</p>
<p class="indenthangingNaa"><strong>2.</strong> Methods to assess an 
architecture before any system is built from it, so as to mitigate the 
risks associated with launching unprecedented designs.</p>
<p class="indenthangingNaa"><strong>3.</strong> Techniques for incremental architecture-based development, so as to uncover design flaws before it is too late to correct them.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Our goal is to give architects another way out of 
their design dilemmas than the one that befell the ill-fated Dutch ship 
designer. Death before deployment is not nearly so admired these days.</p>

<h3 id="ch03lev1sec2"><a id="page_44"></a>3.2. Architecture in a Project Life-Cycle Context</h3>
<p class="noindent">Software development processes are standard 
approaches for developing software systems. They impose a discipline on 
software engineers and, more important, teams of software engineers. 
They tell the members of the team what to do next. There are four 
dominant software development processes, which we describe in roughly 
the order in which they came to prominence:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> <em>Waterfall</em>. For 
many years the Waterfall model dominated the field of software 
development. The Waterfall model organized the life cycle into a series 
of connected sequential activities, each with entry and exit conditions 
and a formalized relationship with its upstream and downstream 
neighbors. The process began with requirements specification, followed 
by design, then implementation, then integration, then testing, then 
installation, all followed by maintenance. Feedback paths from later to 
earlier steps allowed for the revision of artifacts (requirements 
documents, design documents, etc.) on an as-needed basis, based on the 
knowledge acquired in the later stage. For example, designers might push
 back against overly stringent requirements, which would then be 
reworked and flow back down. Testing that uncovered defects would 
trigger reimplementation (and maybe even redesign). And then the cycle 
continued.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> <em>Iterative</em>. Over 
time the feedback paths of the Waterfall model became so pronounced that
 it became clear that it was better to think of software development as a
 series of short cycles through the steps—<em>some</em> requirements lead to <em>some</em>
 design, which can be implemented and tested while the next cycle’s 
worth of requirements are being captured and designed. These cycles are 
called iterations, in the sense of iterating toward the ultimate 
software solution for the given problem. Each iteration should deliver 
something working and useful. The trick here is to uncover early those 
requirements that have the most far-reaching effect on the design; the 
corresponding danger is to overlook requirements that, when discovered 
later, will capsize the design decisions made so far. An especially 
well-known iterative process is called the Unified Process (originally 
named the Rational Unified Process, after Rational Software, which 
originated it). It defines four phases of each iteration: inception, 
elaboration, construction, and transition. A set of chosen use cases 
defines the goals for each iteration, and the iterations are ordered to 
address the greatest risks first.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> <em>Agile</em>. The term 
“Agile software development” refers to a group of software development 
methodologies, the best known of which include Scrum, Extreme 
Programming, and Crystal Clear. These methodologies are all incremental 
and iterative. As such, one can consider some iterative <a id="page_45"></a>methodologies
 as Agile. What distinguishes Agile practices is early and frequent 
delivery of working software, close collaboration between developers and
 customers, self-organizing teams, and a focus on adaptation to changing
 circumstances (such as late-arriving requirements). All Agile 
methodologies focus on teamwork, adaptability, and close collaboration 
(both within the team and between team members and customers/end users).
 These methodologies typically eschew substantial up-front work, on the 
assumption that requirements <em>always</em> change, and they continue 
to change throughout the project’s life cycle. As such, it might seem 
that Agile methodologies and architecture cannot happily coexist. As we 
will show in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch15.html#ch15">Chapter 15</a>, this is not so.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> <em>Model-driven development</em>.
 Model-driven development is based on the idea that humans should not be
 writing code in programming languages, but they should be creating 
models of the domain, from which code is automatically generated. Humans
 create a platform-independent model (PIM), which is combined with a 
platform-definition model (PDM) to generate running code. In this way 
the PIM is a pure realization of the functional requirements while the 
PDM addresses platform specifics and quality attributes.</p>
<p class="indent">All of these processes include design among their 
obligations, and because architecture is a special kind of design, 
architecture finds a home in each one. Changing from one development 
process to another in the middle of a project requires the architect to 
save useful information from the old process and determine how to 
integrate it into the new process.</p>
<p class="indent">No matter what software development process or 
life-cycle model you’re using, there are a number of activities that are
 involved in creating a software architecture, using that architecture 
to realize a complete design, and then implementing or managing the 
evolution of a target system or application. The process you use will 
determine how often and when you revisit and elaborate each of these 
activities. These activities include:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Making a business case for the system</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Understanding the architecturally significant requirements</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Creating or selecting the architecture</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Documenting and communicating the architecture</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> Analyzing or evaluating the architecture</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>6.</strong> Implementing and testing the system based on the architecture</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>7.</strong> Ensuring that the implementation conforms to the architecture</p>
<p class="indent">Each of these activities is covered in a chapter in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/part03.html#part03">Part III</a> of this book, and described briefly below.</p>
<h4 id="ch03lev2sec3"><a id="page_46"></a>Making a Business Case for the System</h4>
<p class="noindent">A business case is, briefly, a justification of an 
organizational investment. It is a tool that helps you make business 
decisions by predicting how they will affect your organization. 
Initially, the decision will be a go/no-go for pursuing a new business 
opportunity or approach. After initiation, the business case is reviewed
 to assess the accuracy of initial estimates and then updated to examine
 new or alternative angles on the opportunity. By documenting the 
expected costs, benefits, and risks, the business case serves as a 
repository of the business and marketing data. In this role, management 
uses the business case to determine possible courses of action.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing the business goals for the system—<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch16.html#ch16">Chapter 16</a>
 will show you how to elicit and capture them in a systematic way—is 
also critical in the creation of a business case for a system.</p>
<p class="indent">Creating a business case is broader than simply 
assessing the market need for a system. It is an important step in 
shaping and constraining any future requirements. How much should the 
product cost? What is its targeted market? What is its targeted time to 
market and lifetime? Will it need to interface with other systems? Are 
there system limitations that it must work within?</p>
<p class="indent">These are all questions about which the system’s 
architects have specialized knowledge; they must contribute to the 
answers. These questions cannot be decided solely by an architect, but 
if an architect is not consulted in the creation of the business case, 
the organization may be unable to achieve its business goals. Typically,
 a business case is created prior to the initiation of a project, but it
 also may be revisited during the course of the project for the 
organization to determine whether to continue making investments in the 
project. If the circumstances assumed in the initial version of the 
business case change, the architect may be called upon to establish how 
the system will change to reflect the new set of circumstances.</p>
<h4 id="ch03lev2sec4">Understanding the Architecturally Significant Requirements</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are a variety of techniques for eliciting 
requirements from the stakeholders. For example, object-oriented 
analysis uses use cases and scenarios to embody requirements. 
Safety-critical systems sometimes use more rigorous approaches, such as 
finite-state-machine models or formal specification languages. In <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/part02.html#part02">Part II</a>
 of this book, which covers quality attributes, we introduce a 
collection of quality attribute scenarios that aid in the brainstorming,
 discussion, and capture of quality attribute requirements for a system.</p>
<p class="indent">One fundamental decision with respect to the system 
being built is the extent to which it is a variation on other systems 
that have been constructed. Because it is a rare system these days that 
is not similar to other systems, requirements <a id="page_47"></a>elicitation
 techniques involve understanding these prior systems’ characteristics. 
We discuss the architectural implications of software product lines in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch25.html#ch25">Chapter 25</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Another technique that helps us understand 
requirements is the creation of prototypes. Prototypes may help to model
 and explore desired behavior, design the user interface, or analyze 
resource utilization. This helps to make the system “real” in the eyes 
of its stakeholders and can quickly build support for the project and 
catalyze decisions on the system’s design and the design of its user 
interface.</p>
<h4 id="ch03lev2sec5">Creating or Selecting the Architecture</h4>
<p class="noindent">In the landmark book <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>,
 Fred Brooks argues forcefully and eloquently that conceptual integrity 
is the key to sound system design and that conceptual integrity can only
 be had by a small number of minds coming together to design the 
system’s architecture. We firmly believe this as well. Good architecture
 almost never results as an emergent phenomenon.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch05.html#ch05">Chapters 5</a>–<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch12.html#ch12">12</a> and <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch17.html#ch17">17</a>
 will provide practical techniques that will aid you in creating an 
architecture to achieve its behavioral and quality requirements.</p>
<h4 id="ch03lev2sec6">Documenting and Communicating the Architecture</h4>
<p class="noindent">For the architecture to be effective as the backbone
 of the project’s design, it must be communicated clearly and 
unambiguously to all of the stakeholders. Developers must understand the
 work assignments that the architecture requires of them, testers must 
understand the task structure that the architecture imposes on them, 
management must understand the scheduling implications it contains, and 
so forth.</p>
<p class="indent">Toward this end, the architecture’s documentation 
should be informative, unambiguous, and readable by many people with 
varied backgrounds. Architectural documentation should also be <em>minimal</em>
 and aimed at the stakeholders who will use it; we are no fans of 
documentation for documentation’s sake. We discuss the documentation of 
architectures and provide examples of good documentation practices in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch18.html#ch18">Chapter 18</a>.
 We will also discuss keeping the architecture up to date when there is a
 change in something on which the architecture documentation depends.</p>
<h4 id="ch03lev2sec7">Analyzing or Evaluating the Architecture</h4>
<p class="noindent">In any design process there will be multiple 
candidate designs considered. Some will be rejected immediately. Others 
will contend for primacy. Choosing among these competing designs in a 
rational way is one of the architect’s greatest challenges.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>Evaluating an architecture for the
 qualities that it supports is essential to ensuring that the system 
constructed from that architecture satisfies its stakeholders’ needs. 
Analysis techniques to evaluate the quality attributes that an 
architecture imparts to a system have become much more widespread in the
 past decade. Scenario-based techniques provide one of the most general 
and effective approaches for evaluating an architecture. The most mature
 methodological approach is found in the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis 
Method (ATAM) of <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch21.html#ch21">Chapter 21</a>, while the economic implications of architectural decisions are explored in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch23.html#ch23">Chapter 23</a>.</p>
<h4 id="ch03lev2sec8">Implementing and Testing the System Based on the Architecture</h4>
<p class="noindent">If the architect designs and analyzes a beautiful, 
conceptually sound architecture which the implementers then ignore, what
 was the point? If architecture is important enough to devote the time 
and effort of your best minds to, then it is just as important to keep 
the developers faithful to the structures and interaction protocols 
constrained by the architecture. Having an explicit and 
well-communicated architecture is the first step toward ensuring <em>architectural conformance</em>.
 Having an environment or infrastructure that actively assists 
developers in creating and maintaining the architecture (as opposed to 
just the code) is better.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many reasons why developers might not be 
faithful to the architecture: It might not have been properly documented
 and disseminated. It might be too confusing. It might be that the 
architect has not built ground-level support for the architecture 
(particularly if it presents a different way of “doing business” than 
the developers are used to), and so the developers resist it. Or the 
developers may sincerely want to implement the architecture but, being 
human, they occasionally slip up. This is not to say that the 
architecture should not change, but it should not change purely on the 
basis of the whims of the developers, because they may not have the 
overall picture.</p>
<h4 id="ch03lev2sec9">Ensuring That the Implementation Conforms to the Architecture</h4>
<p class="noindent">Finally, when an architecture is created and used, 
it goes into a maintenance phase. Vigilance is required to ensure that 
the actual architecture and its representation remain faithful to each 
other during this phase. And when they do get significantly out of sync,
 effort must be expended to either fix the implementation or update the 
architectural documentation.</p>
<p class="indent">Although work in this area is still relatively immature, it has been an area of intense activity in recent years. <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch20.html#ch20">Chapter 20</a>
 will present the current state of recovering an architecture from an 
existing system and ensuring that it conforms to the specified 
architecture.</p>
<h3 id="ch03lev1sec3"><a id="page_49"></a>3.3. Architecture in a Business Context</h3>
<p class="noindent">Architectures and systems are not constructed 
frivolously. They serve some business purposes, although as mentioned 
before, these purposes may change over time.</p>
<h4 id="ch03lev2sec10">Architectures and Business Goals</h4>
<p class="noindent">Systems are created to satisfy the business goals of
 one or more organizations. Development organizations want to make a 
profit, or capture market, or stay in business, or help their customers 
do their jobs better, or keep their staff gainfully employed, or make 
their stockholders happy, or a little bit of each. Customers have their 
own goals for acquiring a system, usually involving some aspect of 
making their lives easier or more productive. Other organizations 
involved in a project’s life cycle, such as subcontractors or government
 regulatory agencies, have their own goals dealing with the system.</p>
<p class="indent">Architects need to understand who the vested 
organizations are and what their goals are. Many of these goals will 
have a profound influence on the architecture.</p>
<p class="indent">Many business goals will be manifested as quality 
attribute requirements. In fact, every quality attribute—such as a 
user-visible response time or platform flexibility or ironclad security 
or any of a dozen other needs—should originate from some higher purpose 
that can be described in terms of added value. If we ask, for example, “<em>Why</em>
 do you want this system to have a really fast response time?” we might 
hear that this will differentiate the product from its competition and 
let the developing organization capture market share.</p>
<p class="indent">Some business goals, however, will not show up in the 
form of requirements. We know of one software architect who was informed
 by his manager that the architecture should include a database. The 
architect was perplexed, because the requirements for the system really 
didn’t warrant a database and the architect’s design had nicely avoided 
putting one in, thereby simplifying the design and lowering the cost of 
the product. The architect was perplexed, that is, until the manager 
reminded the architect that the company’s database department was 
currently overstaffed and underworked. They needed something to do! The 
architect put in the database, and all was well. That kind of business 
goal—keeping staff gainfully employed—is not likely to show up in any 
requirements document, but if the architect had failed to meet it, the 
manager would have considered the architecture as unacceptable, just as 
the customer would have if it failed to provide a key piece of 
functionality.</p>
<p class="indent">Still other business goals have no effect on the 
architecture whatsoever. A business goal to lower costs might be 
realized by asking employees to work from home, or turn the office 
thermostats down in the winter, or using less paper in the printers. <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch16.html#ch16">Chapter 16</a> will deal with uncovering business goals and the requirements they lead to.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_50"></a><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch03.html#ch03fig02">Figure 3.2</a>
 illustrates the major points from the preceding discussion. In the 
figure, the arrows mean “leads to.” The solid arrows highlight the 
relationships of most interest to us.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch03fig02"></a><img data-mfp-src="/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/graphics/03fig02.jpg" src="Chapter3_files/03fig02.jpg" alt="Image" height="200" width="630"></div>
<p class="fig-caption">Figure 3.2. Some business goals may lead to 
quality attribute requirements (which lead to architectures), or lead 
directly to architectural decisions, or lead to nonarchitectural 
solutions.</p>
<h4 id="ch03lev2sec11">Architectures and the Development Organization</h4>
<p class="noindent">A development organization contributes many of the 
business goals that influence an architecture. For example, if the 
organization has an abundance of experienced and idle programmers 
skilled in peer-to-peer communications, then a peer-to-peer architecture
 might be the approach supported by management. If not, it may well be 
rejected. This would support the business goal, perhaps left implicit, 
of not wanting to hire new staff or lay off existing staff, or not 
wanting to invest significantly in the retraining of existing staff.</p>
<p class="indent">More generally, an organization often has an 
investment in assets, such as existing architectures and the products 
based on them. The foundation of a development project may be that the 
proposed system is the next in a sequence of similar systems, and the 
cost estimates assume a high degree of asset reuse and a high degree of 
skill and productivity from the programmers.</p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, an organization may wish to make a 
long-term business investment in an infrastructure to pursue strategic 
goals and may view the proposed system as one means of financing and 
extending that infrastructure. For example, an organization may decide 
that it wants to develop a reputation for supporting solutions based on 
cloud computing or service-oriented architecture or high-performance 
real-time computing. This long-term goal would be supported, in part, by
 infrastructural investments that will affect the developing 
organization: a cloud-computing group needs to be hired or grown, 
infrastructure needs to be purchased, or perhaps training needs to be 
planned.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_51"></a>Finally, the organizational 
structure can shape the software architecture, and vice versa. 
Organizations are often organized around technology and application 
concepts: a database group, a networking group, a business rules team, a
 user-interface group. So the explicit identification of a distinct 
subsystem in the architecture will frequently lead to the creation of a 
group with the name of the subsystem. Furthermore, if the user-interface
 team frequently needs to communicate with the business rules team, 
these teams will need to either be co-located or they will need some 
regular means of communicating and coordinating.</p>
<h3 id="ch03lev1sec4">3.4. Architecture in a Professional Context</h3>
<p class="noindent">What do architects do? How do you become an 
architect? In this section we talk about the many facets of being an 
architect that go beyond what you learned in a programming or software 
engineering course.</p>
<p class="indent">You probably know by now that architects need more 
than just technical skills. Architects need to explain to one 
stakeholder or another the chosen priorities of different properties, 
and why particular stakeholders are not having all of their expectations
 fulfilled. To be an effective architect, then, you will need 
diplomatic, negotiation, and communication skills.</p>
<p class="indent">You will perform many activities beyond directly producing an architecture. These activities, which we call <em>duties</em>,
 form the backbone of individual architecture competence. We surveyed 
the broad body of information aimed at architects (such as websites, 
courses, books, and position descriptions for architects), as well as 
practicing architects, and duties are but one aspect. Writers about 
architects also speak of skills and knowledge. For example, architects 
need the ability to communicate ideas clearly and need to have 
up-to-date knowledge about (for example) patterns, or database 
platforms, or web services standards.</p>
<p class="indent">Duties, skills, and knowledge form a triad on which 
architecture competence rests. You will need to be involved in 
supporting management and dealing with customers. You will need to 
manage a diverse workload and be able to switch contexts frequently. You
 will need to know business considerations. You will need to be a leader
 in the eyes of developers and management. In <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch24.html#ch24">Chapter 24</a> we examine at length the architectural competence of organizations and people.</p>
<h4 id="ch03lev2sec12">Architects’ Background and Experience</h4>
<p class="noindent">We are all products of our experiences, architects 
included. If you have had good results using a particular architectural 
approach, such as three-tier client-server or publish-subscribe, chances
 are that you will try that same approach on a new development effort. 
Conversely, if your experience with an approach was disastrous, you may 
be reluctant to try it again.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_52"></a>Architectural choices may also 
come from your education and training, exposure to successful 
architectural patterns, or exposure to systems that have worked 
particularly poorly or particularly well. You may also wish to 
experiment with an architectural pattern or technique learned from a 
book (such as this one) or a training course.</p>
<p class="indent">Why do we mention this? Because you (and your 
organization) must be aware of this influence, so that you can manage it
 to the best of your abilities. This may mean that you will critically 
examine proposed architectural solutions, to ensure that they are not 
simply the path of least resistance. It may mean that you will take 
training courses in interesting new technologies. It may mean that you 
will invest in exploratory projects, to “test the water” of a new 
technology. Each of these steps is a way to proactively manage your 
background and experience.</p>
<h3 id="ch03lev1sec5">3.5. Stakeholders</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many people and organizations are interested in a software system. We call these entities <em>stakeholders.</em>
 A stakeholder is anyone who has a stake in the success of the system: 
the customer, the end users, the developers, the project manager, the 
maintainers, and even those who market the system, for example. But 
stakeholders, despite all having a shared stake in the success of the 
system, typically have different specific concerns that they wish the 
system to guarantee or optimize. These concerns are as diverse as 
providing a certain behavior at runtime, performing well on a particular
 piece of hardware, being easy to customize, achieving short time to 
market or low cost of development, gainfully employing programmers who 
have a particular specialty, or providing a broad range of functions. <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch03.html#ch03fig03">Figure 3.3</a> shows the architect receiving a few helpful stakeholder “suggestions.”</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch03fig03"></a><img data-mfp-src="/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/graphics/03fig03.jpg" src="Chapter3_files/03fig03.jpg" alt="Image" height="716" width="685"></div>
<p class="fig-caption">Figure 3.3. Influence of stakeholders on the architect</p>
<p class="indent">You will need to know and understand the nature, 
source, and priority of constraints on the project as early as possible.
 Therefore, you must identify and actively engage the stakeholders to 
solicit their needs and expectations. Early engagement of stakeholders 
allows you to understand the constraints of the task, manage 
expectations, negotiate priorities, and make tradeoffs. Architecture 
evaluation (covered in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/part03.html#part03">Part III</a> of this book) and iterative prototyping are two means for you to achieve stakeholder engagement.</p>
<p class="indent">Having an acceptable system involves appropriate 
performance, reliability, availability, platform compatibility, memory 
utilization, network usage, security, modifiability, usability, and 
interoperability with other systems as well as behavior. All of these 
qualities, and others, affect how the delivered system is viewed by its 
eventual recipients, and so such quality attributes will be demanded by 
one or more of the system’s stakeholders.</p>
<p class="indent">The underlying problem, of course, is that each 
stakeholder has different concerns and goals, some of which may be 
contradictory. It is a rare requirements <a id="page_53"></a>document 
that does a good job of capturing all of a system’s quality requirements
 in testable detail (a property is testable if it is falsifiable; “make 
the system easy to use” is not falsifiable but “deliver audio packets 
with no more than 10 ms. jitter” is falsifiable). The architect often 
has to fill in the blanks—the quality attribute requirements that have 
not been explicitly stated—and mediate the conflicts that frequently 
emerge.</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, one of the best pieces of advice we can 
give to architects is this: Know your stakeholders. Talk to them, engage
 them, listen to them, and put yourself in their shoes. <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch03.html#ch03tab01">Table 3.1</a>
 enumerates a set of stakeholders. Notice the remarkable variety and 
length of this set, but remember that not every stakeholder named in 
this list may play a role in every system, and one person may play many 
roles.</p>
<p class="tab-caption"><a id="page_54"></a><a id="ch03tab01"></a>Table 3.1. Stakeholders for a System and Their Interests</p>
<div class="image"><img data-mfp-src="/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/graphics/03tab01.jpg" src="Chapter3_files/03tab01.jpg" alt="Image" height="529" width="1018"></div>

<h3 id="ch03lev1sec6"><a id="page_56"></a>3.6. How Is Architecture Influenced?</h3>
<p class="noindent">For decades, software designers have been taught to 
build systems based on the software’s technical requirements. In the 
older Waterfall model, the requirements document is “tossed over the 
wall” into the designer’s cubicle, and the designer must come forth with
 a satisfactory design. Requirements beget design, which begets system. 
In an iterative or Agile approach to development, an increment of 
requirements begets an increment of design, and so forth.</p>
<p class="indent">This vision of software development is short-sighted. 
In any development effort, the requirements make explicit some—but only 
some—of the desired properties of the final system. Not all requirements
 are focused directly on desired system properties; some requirements 
might mandate a development process or the use of a particular tool. 
Furthermore, the requirements specification only begins to tell the 
story. Failure to satisfy other constraints may render the system just 
as problematic as if it functioned poorly.</p>
<p class="indent">What do you suppose would happen if two different 
architects, working in two different organizations, were given the same 
requirements specification for a system? Do you think they would produce
 the same architecture or different ones?</p>
<p class="indent">The answer is that they would very likely produce different ones, which immediately belies the notion that requirements <em>determine</em> architecture. Other factors are at work.</p>
<p class="indent">A software architecture is a result of business and 
social influences, as well as technical ones. The existence of an 
architecture in turn affects the technical, business, and social 
environments that subsequently influence future architectures. In 
particular, each of the contexts for architecture that we just 
covered—technical, project, business, and professional—plays a role in 
influencing an architect and the architecture, as shown in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch03.html#ch03fig04">Figure 3.4</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch03fig04"></a><img data-mfp-src="/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/graphics/03fig04.jpg" src="Chapter3_files/03fig04.jpg" alt="Image" height="294" width="630"></div>
<p class="fig-caption">Figure 3.4. Influences on the architect</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_57"></a>An architect designing a system 
for which the real-time deadlines are tight will make one set of design 
choices; the same architect, designing a similar system in which the 
deadlines can be easily satisfied, will make different choices. And the 
same architect, designing a non-real-time system, is likely to make 
quite different choices still. Even with the same requirements, 
hardware, support software, and human resources available, an architect 
designing a system today is likely to design a different system than 
might have been designed five years ago.</p>
<h3 id="ch03lev1sec7">3.7. What Do Architectures Influence?</h3>
<p class="noindent">The story about contexts influencing architectures 
has a flip side. It turns out that architectures have an influence on 
the very factors that influence them. Specifically, the existence of an 
architecture affects the technical, project, business, and professional 
contexts that subsequently influence future architectures.</p>
<p class="indent">Here is how the cycle works:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>Technical context.</em> The architecture
 can affect stakeholder requirements for the next system by giving the 
customer the opportunity to receive a system (based on the same 
architecture) in a more reliable, timely, and economical manner than if 
the subsequent system were to be built from scratch, and typically with 
fewer defects. A customer may in fact be willing to relax some of their 
requirements to gain these economies. Shrink-wrapped software has 
clearly affected people’s requirements by providing solutions that are 
not tailored to any individual’s precise needs but are instead 
inexpensive and (in the best of all possible worlds) of high quality. 
Software product lines have the same effect on customers who cannot be 
so flexible with their requirements.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>Project context.</em> The architecture 
affects the structure of the developing organization. An architecture 
prescribes a structure for a system; as we will see, it particularly 
prescribes the units of software that must be implemented (or otherwise 
obtained) and integrated to form the system. These units are the basis 
for the development project’s structure. Teams are formed for individual
 software units; and the development, test, and integration activities 
all revolve around the units. Likewise, schedules and budgets allocate 
resources in chunks corresponding to the units. If a company becomes 
adept at building families of similar systems, it will tend to invest in
 each team by nurturing each area of expertise. Teams become embedded in
 the organization’s structure. This is feedback from the architecture to
 the developing organization. In any design undertaken by the 
organization at large, these groups have a strong voice in the system’s 
decomposition, pressuring for the continued existence of the portions 
they control.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_58"></a>• <em>Business context.</em>
 The architecture can affect the business goals of the developing 
organization. A successful system built from an architecture can enable a
 company to establish a foothold in a particular market segment—think of
 the iPhone or Android app platforms as examples. The architecture can 
provide opportunities for the efficient production and deployment of 
similar systems, and the organization may adjust its goals to take 
advantage of its newfound expertise to plumb the market. This is 
feedback from the system to the developing organization and the systems 
it builds.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>Professional context.</em> The process 
of system building will affect the architect’s experience with 
subsequent systems by adding to the corporate experience base. A system 
that was successfully built around a particular technical approach will 
make the architect more inclined to build systems using the same 
approach in the future. On the other hand, architectures that fail are 
less likely to be chosen for future projects.</p>
<p class="indent">These and other feedback mechanisms form what we call the Architecture Influence Cycle, or AIC, illustrated in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch03.html#ch03fig05">Figure 3.5</a>,
 which depicts the influences of the culture and business of the 
development organization on the software architecture. That architecture
 is, in turn, a primary determinant of the properties of the developed 
system or systems. But the AIC is also based on a recognition that 
shrewd organizations can take advantage of the organizational and 
experiential effects of developing an architecture and can use those 
effects to position their business strategically for future projects.</p>

<p class="noindent">Architectures exist in four different contexts.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> <em>Technical.</em> The technical context includes the achievement of quality attribute requirements. We spend <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/part02.html#part02">Part II</a> discussing how to do this. The technical context also includes the current technology. The cloud (discussed in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch26.html#ch26">Chapter 26</a>) and mobile computing (discussed in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch27.html#ch27">Chapter 27</a>) are important current technologies.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> <em>Project life cycle.</em>
 Regardless of the software development methodology you use, you must 
make a business case for the system, understand the architecturally 
significant requirements, create or select the architecture, document 
and communicate the architecture, analyze or evaluate the architecture, 
implement and test the system based on the architecture, and ensure that
 the implementation conforms to the architecture.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> <em>Business.</em> The 
system created from the architecture must satisfy the business goals of a
 wide variety of stakeholders, each of whom has different expectations 
for the system. The architecture is also influenced by and influences 
the structure of the development organization.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> <em>Professional.</em> You
 must have certain skills and knowledge to be an architect, and there 
are certain duties that you must perform as an architect. These are 
influenced not only by coursework and reading but also by your 
experiences.</p>
<p class="indent">An architecture has some influences that lead to its 
creation, and its existence has an impact on the architect, the 
organization, and, potentially, the industry. We call this cycle the 
Architecture Influence Cycle.</p>

<p class="noindent">The product line framework produced by the Software 
Engineering Institute includes a discussion of business cases from which
 we drew <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/app01.html#bib01_173">[SEI 12]</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">The SEI has also published a case study of Celsius 
Tech that includes an example of how organizations and customers change 
over time <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/app01.html#bib01_036">[Brownsword 96]</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Several other SEI reports discuss how to find business
 goals and the business goals that have been articulated by certain 
organizations [<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/app01.html#bib01_109">Kazman 05</a>, <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/app01.html#bib01_052">Clements 10b</a>].</p>
<p class="indent">Ruth Malan and Dana Bredemeyer provide a description of how an architect can build buy-in within an organization <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/app01.html#bib01_132">[Malan 00]</a>.</p>
