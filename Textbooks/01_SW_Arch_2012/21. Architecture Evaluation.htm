<p class="blockquote"><em>Fear cannot be banished, but it can be calm and without panic; it can be mitigated by reason and evaluation.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">We discussed analysis techniques in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</a>.
 Analysis lies at the heart of architecture evaluation, which is the 
process of determining if an architecture is fit for the purpose for 
which it is intended. Architecture is such an important contributor to 
the success of a system and software engineering project that it makes 
sense to pause and make sure that the architecture you’ve designed will 
be able to provide all that’s expected of it. That’s the role of 
evaluation. Fortunately there are mature methods to evaluate 
architectures that use many of the concepts and techniques you’ve 
already learned in previous chapters of this book.</p>
<h3 id="ch21lev1sec1">21.1. Evaluation Factors</h3>
<p class="noindent">Evaluation usually takes one of three forms:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Evaluation by the designer within the design process</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Evaluation by peers within the design process</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Analysis by outsiders once the architecture has been designed</p>
<h4 id="ch21lev2sec1">Evaluation by the Designer</h4>
<p class="noindent">Every time the designer makes a key design decision 
or completes a design milestone, the chosen and competing alternatives 
should be evaluated using the analysis techniques of <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</a>. Evaluation by the designer is the “test” part of the “generate-and-test” approach to architecture design that we discussed in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch17.html#ch17">Chapter 17</a>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_398"></a>How much analysis? This depends 
on the importance of the decision. Obviously, decisions made to achieve 
one of the driving architectural requirements should be subject to more 
analysis than others, because these are the ones that will shape 
critical portions of the architecture. But in all cases, performing 
analysis is a matter of cost and benefit. Do not spend more time on a 
decision than it is worth, but also do not spend less time on an 
important decision than it needs. Some specific considerations include 
these:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>The importance of the decision</em>. The more important the decision, the more care should be taken in making it and making sure it’s right.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>The number of potential alternatives.</em>
 The more alternatives, the more time could be spent in evaluating them.
 Try to eliminate alternatives quickly so that the number of viable 
potential alternatives is small.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>Good enough as opposed to perfect.</em> 
Many times, two possible alternatives do not differ dramatically in 
their consequences. In such a case, it is more important to make a 
choice and move on with the design process than it is to be absolutely 
certain that the best choice is being made. Again, do not spend more 
time on a decision than it is worth.</p>
<h4 id="ch21lev2sec2">Peer Review</h4>
<p class="noindent">Architectural designs can be peer reviewed just as 
code can be peer reviewed. A peer review can be carried out at any point
 of the design process where a candidate architecture, or at least a 
coherent reviewable part of one, exists. There should be a fixed amount 
of time allocated for the peer review, at least several hours and 
possibly half a day. A peer review has several steps:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> <em>The reviewers determine a number of quality attribute scenarios to drive the review.</em>
 Most of the time these scenarios will be architecturally significant 
requirements, but they need not be. These scenarios can be developed by 
the review team or by additional stakeholders.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> <em>The architect presents the portion of the architecture to be evaluated.</em>
 (At this point, comprehensive documentation for it may not exist.) The 
reviewers individually ensure that they understand the architecture. 
Questions at this point are specifically for understanding. There is no 
debate about the decisions that were made. These come in the next step.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> <em>For each scenario, the designer walks through the architecture and explains how the scenario is satisfied.</em>
 (If the architecture is already documented, then the reviews can use it
 to assess for themselves how it satisfies the scenario.) The reviewers 
ask questions to determine two different types of information. First, 
they want to determine that the scenario is, in fact, satisfied. Second,
 they want to determine whether any of the other scenarios being 
considered will not be satisfied because of the decisions made in the 
portion of the architecture being reviewed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><a id="page_399"></a><strong>4.</strong> <em>Potential problems are captured.</em>
 The list of potential problems forms the basis for the follow-up of the
 review. If the potential problem is a real problem, then it either must
 be fixed or a decision must be explicitly made by the designers and the
 project manager that they are willing to accept the problem and its 
probability of occurrence.</p>
<p class="indent">If the designers are using the ADD process described in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch17.html#ch17">Chapter 17</a>, then a peer review can be done at the end of step 3 of each ADD iteration.</p>
<h4 id="ch21lev2sec3">Analysis by Outsiders</h4>
<p class="noindent">Outside evaluators can cast an objective eye on an 
architecture. “Outside” is relative; this may mean outside the 
development project, outside the business unit where the project resides
 but within the same company; or outside the company altogether. To the 
degree that evaluators are “outside,” they are less likely to be afraid 
to bring up sensitive problems, or problems that aren’t apparent because
 of organizational culture or because “we’ve always done it that way.”</p>
<p class="indent">Often, outsiders are chosen because they possess 
specialized knowledge or experience, such as knowledge about a quality 
attribute that’s important to the system being examined, or long 
experience in successfully evaluating architectures.</p>
<p class="indent">Also, whether justified or not, managers tend to be 
more inclined to listen to problems uncovered by an outside team hired 
at considerable cost. (This can be understandably frustrating to project
 staff who may have been complaining about the same problems to no avail
 for months.)</p>
<p class="indent">In principle, an outside team may evaluate a completed
 architecture, an incomplete architecture, or a portion of an 
architecture. In practice, because engaging them is complicated and 
often expensive, they tend to be used to evaluate complete 
architectures.</p>
<h4 id="ch21lev2sec4">Contextual Factors</h4>
<p class="noindent">For peer reviews or outside analysis, there are a 
number of contextual factors that must be considered when structuring an
 evaluation. These include the artifacts available, whether the results 
are public or private, the number and skill of evaluators, the number 
and identity of the participating stakeholders, and how the business 
goals are understood by the evaluators.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>What artifacts are available?</em> To 
perform an architectural evaluation, there must be an artifact that 
describes the architecture. This must be located and made available. 
Some evaluations may take place after the system is operational. In this
 case, recovery tools as described in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch20.html#ch20">Chapter 20</a>
 may be used both to assist in discovering the architecture and to test 
that the as-built system conforms to the as-designed system.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_400"></a>• <em>Who sees the results?</em>
 Some evaluations are performed with the full knowledge and 
participation of all of the stakeholders. Others are performed more 
privately. The private evaluations may be done for a variety of reasons,
 ranging from corporate culture to (in one case we know about) an 
executive wanting to determine which of a collection of competitive 
systems he should back in an internal dispute about the systems.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>Who performs the evaluation?</em> 
Evaluations can be carried out by an individual or a team. In either 
case, the evaluator(s) should be highly skilled in the domain and the 
various quality attributes for which the system is to be evaluated. And 
for carrying out evaluation methods with extensive stakeholder 
involvement, excellent organizational and facilitation skills are a 
must.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>Which stakeholders will participate?</em>
 The evaluation process should provide a method to elicit the goals and 
concerns that the important stakeholders have regarding the system. 
Identifying the individuals who are needed and assuring their 
participation in the evaluation is critical.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>What are the business goals?</em> The 
evaluation should answer whether the system will satisfy the business 
goals. If the business goals are not explicitly captured and prioritized
 prior to the evaluation, then there should be a portion of the 
evaluation dedicated to doing so.</p>
<h3 id="ch21lev1sec2">21.2. The Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) has
 been used for over a decade to evaluate software architectures in 
domains ranging from automotive to financial to defense. The ATAM is 
designed so that evaluators need not be familiar with the architecture 
or its business goals, the system need not yet be constructed, and there
 may be a large number of stakeholders.</p>
<h4 id="ch21lev2sec5">Participants in the ATAM</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ATAM requires the participation and mutual cooperation of three groups:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>The evaluation team.</em> This group is 
external to the project whose architecture is being evaluated. It 
usually consists of three to five people. Each member of the team is 
assigned a number of specific roles to play during the evaluation. (See <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch21.html#ch21tab01">Table 21.1</a>
 for a description of these roles, along with a set of desirable 
characteristics for each. A single person may adopt several roles in an 
ATAM.) The evaluation team may be a standing unit in which architecture 
evaluations are regularly performed, or its members may be chosen from a
 pool of architecturally savvy individuals for the occasion. <a id="page_401"></a>They
 may work for the same organization as the development team whose 
architecture is on the table, or they may be outside consultants. In any
 case, they need to be recognized as competent, unbiased outsiders with 
no hidden agendas or axes to grind.</p>
<p class="tab-caption"><a id="ch21tab01"></a>Table 21.1. ATAM Evaluation Team Roles</p>
<div class="image"><img data-mfp-src="/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/graphics/21tab01.jpg" src="21.%20Architecture%20Evaluation_files/21tab01.jpg" alt="Image" height="384" width="630"></div>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>Project decision makers.</em> These 
people are empowered to speak for the development project or have the 
authority to mandate changes to it. They usually include the project 
manager, and if there is an identifiable customer who is footing the 
bill for the development, he or she may be present (or represented) as 
well. The architect is always included—a cardinal rule of architecture 
evaluation is that the architect must willingly participate.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• <em>Architecture stakeholders.</em> 
Stakeholders have a vested interest in the architecture performing as 
advertised. They are the ones whose ability to do their job hinges on 
the architecture promoting modifiability, security, high reliability, or
 the like. Stakeholders include developers, testers, integrators, 
maintainers, performance engineers, users, builders of systems 
interacting with the one under consideration, and others listed in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>.
 Their job during an evaluation is to articulate the specific quality 
attribute goals that the architecture should meet in order for the 
system to be considered a success. A rule of thumb—and that is all it 
is—is that you should expect to enlist 12 to 15 stakeholders for the 
evaluation of a large enterprise-critical architecture. Unlike the 
evaluation team and the project decision makers, stakeholders do not 
participate in the entire exercise.</p>
<h4 id="ch21lev2sec6"><a id="page_402"></a>Outputs of the ATAM</h4>
<p class="noindent">As in any testing process, a large benefit derives 
from preparing for the test. In preparation for an ATAM exercise, the 
project’s decision makers must prepare the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> <em>A concise presentation of the architecture.</em>
 One of the requirements of the ATAM is that the architecture be 
presented in one hour, which leads to an architectural presentation that
 is both concise and, usually, understandable.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> <em>Articulation of the business goals.</em>
 Frequently, the business goals presented in the ATAM are being seen by 
some of the assembled participants for the first time, and these are 
captured in the outputs. This description of the business goals survives
 the evaluation and becomes part of the project’s legacy.</p>
<p class="indent">The ATAM uses prioritized quality attribute scenarios 
as the basis for evaluating the architecture, and if those scenarios do 
not already exist (perhaps as a result of a prior requirements capture 
exercise or ADD activity), they are generated by the participants as 
part of the ATAM exercise. Many times, ATAM participants have told us 
that one of the most valuable outputs of ATAM is this next output:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> <em>Prioritized quality attribute requirements expressed as quality attribute scenarios.</em> These quality attribute scenarios take the form described in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>. These also survive past the evaluation and can be used to guide the architecture’s evolution.</p>
<p class="indent">The primary output of the ATAM is a set of issues of concern about the architecture. We call these risks:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> <em>A set of risks and nonrisks.</em>
 A risk is defined in the ATAM as an architectural decision that may 
lead to undesirable consequences in light of stated quality attribute 
requirements. Similarly, a nonrisk is an architectural decision that, 
upon analysis, is deemed safe. The identified risks form the basis for 
an architectural risk mitigation plan.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> <em>A set of risk themes.</em>
 When the analysis is complete, the evaluation team examines the full 
set of discovered risks to look for overarching themes that identify 
systemic weaknesses in the architecture or even in the architecture 
process and team. If left untreated, these risk themes will threaten the
 project’s business goals.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, along the way, other information about the architecture is discovered and captured:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>6.</strong> <em>Mapping of architectural decisions to quality requirements.</em>
 Architectural decisions can be interpreted in terms of the qualities 
that they support or hinder. For each quality attribute scenario 
examined during an ATAM, those <a id="page_403"></a>architectural 
decisions that help to achieve it are determined and captured. This can 
serve as a statement of rationale for those decisions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>7.</strong> <em>A set of identified sensitivity and tradeoff points</em>. These are architectural decisions that have a marked effect on one or more quality attributes.</p>
<p class="indent">The outputs of the ATAM are used to build a final 
written report that recaps the method, summarizes the proceedings, 
captures the scenarios and their analysis, and catalogs the findings.</p>
<p class="indent">There are intangible results of an ATAM-based 
evaluation. These include a palpable sense of community on the part of 
the stakeholders, open communication channels between the architect and 
the stakeholders, and a better overall understanding on the part of all 
participants of the architecture and its strengths and weaknesses. While
 these results are hard to measure, they are no less important than the 
others and often are the longest-lasting.</p>
<h4 id="ch21lev2sec7">Phases of the ATAM</h4>
<p class="noindent">Activities in an ATAM-based evaluation are spread out over four phases:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• In phase 0, “Partnership and Preparation,” 
the evaluation team leadership and the key project decision makers 
informally meet to work out the details of the exercise. The project 
representatives brief the evaluators about the project so that the team 
can be supplemented by people who possess the appropriate expertise. 
Together, the two groups agree on logistics, such as the time and place 
of meetings, who brings the flipcharts, and who supplies the donuts and 
coffee. They also agree on a preliminary list of stakeholders (by name, 
not just role), and they negotiate on when the final report is to be 
delivered and to whom. They deal with formalities such as a statement of
 work or nondisclosure agreements. The evaluation team examines the 
architecture documentation to gain an understanding of the architecture 
and the major design approaches that it comprises. Finally, the 
evaluation team leader explains what information the manager and 
architect will be expected to show during phase 1, and helps them 
construct their presentations if necessary.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Phase 1 and phase 2 are the evaluation 
phases, where everyone gets down to the business of analysis. By now the
 evaluation team will have studied the architecture documentation and 
will have a good idea of what the system is about, the overall 
architectural approaches taken, and the quality attributes that are of 
paramount importance. During phase 1, the evaluation team meets with the
 project decision makers (for one to two days) to begin information 
gathering and analysis. For phase 2, the architecture’s stakeholders 
join the proceedings and analysis continues, typically for two days. 
Unlike the other phases, phase 1 and phase 2 comprise a set of specific 
steps; these are detailed in the next section.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_404"></a>• Phase 3 is follow-up, 
in which the evaluation team produces and delivers a written final 
report. It is first circulated to key stakeholders to make sure that it 
contains no errors of understanding, and after this review is complete 
it is delivered to the person who commissioned the evaluation.</p>

<h4 id="ch21lev2sec8">Steps of the Evaluation Phases</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ATAM analysis phases (phase 1 and phase 2) 
consist of nine steps. Steps 1 through 6 are carried out in phase 1 with
 the evaluation team and the project’s decision makers: typically, the 
architecture team, project manager, and project sponsor. In phase 2, 
with all stakeholders present, steps 1 through 6 are summarized and 
steps 7 through 9 are carried out.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch21.html#ch21tab03">Table 21.3</a>
 shows a typical agenda for the first day of phase 1, which covers steps
 1 through 5. Step 6 in phase 1 is carried out the next day.</p>

<h5 id="ch21lev3sec1">Step 1: Present the ATAM</h5>
<p class="noindent">The first step calls for the evaluation leader to 
present the ATAM to the assembled project representatives. This time is 
used to explain the process that everyone will be following, to answer 
questions, and to set the context and expectations for the remainder of 
the activities. Using a standard presentation, the leader describes the 
ATAM steps in brief and the outputs of the evaluation.</p>
<h5 id="ch21lev3sec2">Step 2: Present the Business Drivers</h5>
<p class="noindent">Everyone involved in the evaluation—the project 
representatives as well as the evaluation team members—needs to 
understand the context for the system and the primary business drivers <a id="page_405"></a>motivating
 its development. In this step, a project decision maker (ideally the 
project manager or the system’s customer) presents a system overview 
from a business perspective. The presentation should describe the 
following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The system’s most important functions</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Any relevant technical, managerial, economic, or political constraints</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The business goals and context as they relate to the project</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The major stakeholders</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The architectural drivers (that is, the architecturally significant requirements)</p>
<h5 id="ch21lev3sec3">Step 3: Present the Architecture</h5>
<p class="noindent">Here, the lead architect (or architecture team) 
makes a presentation describing the architecture at an appropriate level
 of detail. The “appropriate level” depends on several factors: how much
 of the architecture has been designed and documented; how much time is 
available; and the nature of the behavioral and quality requirements.</p>
<p class="indent">In this presentation the architect covers technical 
constraints such as operating system, hardware, or middleware prescribed
 for use, and other systems with which the system must interact. Most 
important, the architect describes the architectural approaches (or 
patterns, or tactics, if the architect is fluent in that vocabulary) 
used to meet the requirements.</p>
<p class="indent">To make the most of limited time, the architect’s 
presentation should have a high signal-to-noise ratio. That is, it 
should convey the essence of the architecture and not stray into 
ancillary areas or delve too deeply into the details of just a few 
aspects. Thus, it is extremely helpful to brief the architect beforehand
 (in phase 0) about the information the evaluation team requires. A 
template such as the one in the sidebar can help the architect prepare 
the presentation. Depending on the architect, a dress rehearsal can be 
included as part of the phase 0 activities.</p>

<hr></div>
<p class="indent">As may be seen in the presentation template, we expect architectural views, as described in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch01.html#ch01">Chapters 1</a> and <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch18.html#ch18">18</a>,
 to be the primary vehicle for the architect to convey the architecture.
 Context diagrams, component-and-connector views, module decomposition 
or layered views, and the deployment view are useful in almost every 
evaluation, and the architect should be prepared to show them. Other 
views can be presented if they contain information relevant to the 
architecture at hand, especially information relevant to achieving 
important quality attribute goals.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_407"></a>As a rule of thumb, the architect
 should present the views that he or she found most important during the
 creation of the architecture and the views that help to reason about 
the most important quality attribute concerns of the system.</p>
<p class="indent">During the presentation, the evaluation team asks for 
clarification based on their phase 0 examination of the architecture 
documentation and their knowledge of the business drivers from the 
previous step. They also listen for and write down any architectural 
tactics or patterns they see employed.</p>
<h5 id="ch21lev3sec4">Step 4: Identify Architectural Approaches</h5>
<p class="noindent">The ATAM focuses on analyzing an architecture by understanding its architectural approaches. As we saw in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch13.html#ch13">Chapter 13</a>,
 architectural patterns and tactics are useful for (among other reasons)
 the known ways in which each one affects particular quality attributes.
 A layered pattern tends to bring portability and maintainability to a 
system, possibly at the expense of performance. A publish-subscribe 
pattern is scalable in the number of producers and consumers of data. 
The active redundancy tactic promotes high availability. And so forth.</p>
<p class="indent">By now, the evaluation team will have a good idea of 
what patterns and tactics the architect used in designing the system. 
They will have studied the architecture documentation, and they will 
have heard the architect’s presentation in step 3. During that step, the
 architect is asked to explicitly name the patterns and tactics used, 
but the team should also be adept at spotting ones not mentioned.</p>
<p class="indent">In this short step, the evaluation team simply 
catalogs the patterns and tactics that have been identified. The list is
 publicly captured by the scribe for all to see and will serve as the 
basis for later analysis.</p>
<h5 id="ch21lev3sec5">Step 5: Generate Quality Attribute Utility Tree</h5>
<p class="noindent">In this step, the quality attribute goals are 
articulated in detail via a quality attribute utility tree. Utility 
trees, which were described in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch16.html#ch16">Chapter 16</a>,
 serve to make the requirements concrete by defining precisely the 
relevant quality attribute requirements that the architects were working
 to provide.</p>
<p class="indent">The important quality attribute goals for the 
architecture under consideration were named in step 2, when the business
 drivers were presented, but not to any degree of specificity that would
 permit analysis. Broad goals such as “modifiability” or “high 
throughput” or “ability to be ported to a number of platforms” establish
 important context and direction, and provide a backdrop against which 
subsequent information is presented. However, they are not specific 
enough to let us tell if the architecture suffices. Modifiable in what 
way? Throughput that is how high? Ported to what platforms and in how 
much time?</p>
<p class="indent">In this step, the evaluation team works with the 
project decision makers to identify, prioritize, and refine the system’s
 most important quality attribute goals. These are expressed as 
scenarios, as described in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>, which populate the leaves of the utility tree.</p>
<h5 id="ch21lev3sec6"><a id="page_408"></a>Step 6: Analyze Architectural Approaches</h5>
<p class="noindent">Here the evaluation team examines the highest-ranked
 scenarios (as identified in the utility tree) one at a time; the 
architect is asked to explain how the architecture supports each one. 
Evaluation team members—especially the questioners—probe for the 
architectural approaches that the architect used to carry out the 
scenario. Along the way, the evaluation team documents the relevant 
architectural decisions and identifies and catalogs their risks, 
nonrisks, sensitivity points, and tradeoffs. For well-known approaches, 
the evaluation team asks how the architect overcame known weaknesses in 
the approach or how the architect gained assurance that the approach 
sufficed. The goal is for the evaluation team to be convinced that the 
instantiation of the approach is appropriate for meeting the 
attribute-specific requirements for which it is intended.</p>
<p class="indent">Scenario walkthrough leads to a discussion of possible risks, nonrisks, sensitivity points, or tradeoff points. For example:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The frequency of heartbeats affects the time
 in which the system can detect a failed component. Some assignments 
will result in unacceptable values of this response—these are risks.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The number of simultaneous database clients 
will affect the number of transactions that a database can process per 
second. Thus, the assignment of clients to the server is a sensitivity 
point with respect to the response as measured in transactions per 
second.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The frequency of heartbeats determines the 
time for detection of a fault. Higher frequency leads to improved 
availability but will also consume more processing time and 
communication bandwidth (potentially leading to reduced performance). 
This is a tradeoff.</p>
<p class="indent">These, in turn, may catalyze a deeper analysis, 
depending on how the architect responds. For example, if the architect 
cannot characterize the number of clients and cannot say how load 
balancing will be achieved by allocating processes to hardware, there is
 little point in a sophisticated performance analysis. If such questions
 can be answered, the evaluation team can perform at least a 
rudimentary, or back-of-the-envelope, analysis to determine if these 
architectural decisions are problematic vis-à-vis the quality attribute 
requirements they are meant to address.</p>
<p class="indent">The analysis is not meant to be comprehensive. The key
 is to elicit sufficient architectural information to establish some 
link between the architectural decisions that have been made and the 
quality attribute requirements that need to be satisfied.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch21.html#ch21fig01">Figure 21.1</a>
 shows a template for capturing the analysis of an architectural 
approach for a scenario. As shown, based on the results of this step, 
the evaluation team can identify and record a set of sensitivity points 
and tradeoffs, risks, and nonrisks.</p>

<p class="fig-caption">Figure 21.1. Example of architecture approach analysis (adapted from <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/app01.html#bib01_049">[Clements 01b]</a>)</p>
<p class="indent">At the end of step 6, the evaluation team should have a
 clear picture of the most important aspects of the entire architecture,
 the rationale for key design decisions, and a list of risks, nonrisks, 
sensitivity points, and tradeoff points.</p>
<p class="indent">At this point, phase 1 is concluded.</p>
<h5 id="ch21lev3sec7"><a id="page_409"></a>Hiatus and Start of Phase 2</h5>
<p class="noindent">The evaluation team summarizes what it has learned 
and interacts informally (usually by phone) with the architect during a 
hiatus of a week or two. More scenarios might be analyzed during this 
period, if desired, or questions of clarification can be resolved.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_410"></a>Phase 2 is attended by an 
expanded list of participants with additional stakeholders attending. To
 use an analogy from programming: Phase 1 is akin to when you test your 
own program, using your own criteria. Phase 2 is when you give your 
program to an independent quality assurance group, who will likely 
subject your program to a wider variety of tests and environments.</p>
<p class="indent">In phase 2, step 1 is repeated so that the 
stakeholders understand the method and the roles they are to play. Then 
the evaluation leader recaps the results of steps 2 through 6, and 
shares the current list of risks, nonrisks, sensitivity points, and 
tradeoffs. Now the stakeholders are up to speed with the evaluation 
results so far, and the remaining three steps can be carried out.</p>
<h5 id="ch21lev3sec8">Step 7: Brainstorm and Prioritize Scenarios</h5>
<p class="noindent">In this step, the evaluation team asks the 
stakeholders to brainstorm scenarios that are operationally meaningful 
with respect to the stakeholders’ individual roles. A maintainer will 
likely propose a modifiability scenario, while a user will probably come
 up with a scenario that expresses useful functionality or ease of 
operation, and a quality assurance person will propose a scenario about 
testing the system or being able to replicate the state of the system 
leading up to a fault.</p>
<p class="indent">While utility tree generation (step 5) is used 
primarily to understand how the architect perceived and handled quality 
attribute architectural drivers, the purpose of scenario brainstorming 
is to take the pulse of the larger stakeholder community: to understand 
what system success means for them. Scenario brainstorming works well in
 larger groups, creating an atmosphere in which the ideas and thoughts 
of one person stimulate others’ ideas.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the scenarios have been collected, they must be 
prioritized, for the same reasons that the scenarios in the utility tree
 needed to be prioritized: the evaluation team needs to know where to 
devote its limited analytical time. First, stakeholders are asked to 
merge scenarios they feel represent the same behavior or quality 
concern. Then they vote for those they feel are most important. Each 
stakeholder is allocated a number of votes equal to 30 percent of the 
number of scenarios,<sup><a class="totri-footnote" id="ch21fn01" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/footnotes.html#ch21fn01a">1</a></sup>
 rounded up. So, if there were 40 scenarios collected, each stakeholder 
would be given 12 votes. These votes can be allocated in any way that 
the stakeholder sees fit: all 12 votes for 1 scenario, 1 vote for each 
of 12 distinct scenarios, or anything in between.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of prioritized scenarios is compared with 
those from the utility tree exercise. If they agree, it indicates good 
alignment between what the architect had in mind and what the 
stakeholders actually wanted. If additional driving scenarios are 
discovered—and they usually are—this may itself be a risk, if the 
discrepancy is large. This would indicate that there was some 
disagreement in the system’s important goals between the stakeholders 
and the architect.</p>
<h5 id="ch21lev3sec9"><a id="page_411"></a>Step 8: Analyze Architectural Approaches</h5>
<p class="noindent">After the scenarios have been collected and 
prioritized in step 7, the evaluation team guides the architect in the 
process of carrying out the highest ranked scenarios. The architect 
explains how relevant architectural decisions contribute to realizing 
each one. Ideally this activity will be dominated by the architect’s 
explanation of scenarios in terms of previously discussed architectural 
approaches.</p>
<p class="indent">In this step the evaluation team performs the same activities as in step 6, using the highest-ranked, newly generated scenarios.</p>
<p class="indent">Typically, this step might cover the top five to ten scenarios, as time permits.</p>
<h5 id="ch21lev3sec10">Step 9: Present Results</h5>
<p class="noindent">In step 9, the evaluation team groups risks into 
risk themes, based on some common underlying concern or systemic 
deficiency. For example, a group of risks about inadequate or 
out-of-date documentation might be grouped into a risk theme stating 
that documentation is given insufficient consideration. A group of risks
 about the system’s inability to function in the face of various 
hardware and/or software failures might lead to a risk theme about 
insufficient attention to backup capability or providing high 
availability.</p>
<p class="indent">For each risk theme, the evaluation team identifies 
which of the business drivers listed in step 2 are affected. Identifying
 risk themes and then relating them to specific drivers brings the 
evaluation full circle by relating the final results to the initial 
presentation, thus providing a satisfying closure to the exercise. As 
important, it elevates the risks that were uncovered to the attention of
 management. What might otherwise have seemed to a manager like an 
esoteric technical issue is now identified unambiguously as a threat to 
something the manager is on record as caring about.</p>
<p class="indent">The collected information from the evaluation is 
summarized and presented to stakeholders. This takes the form of a 
verbal presentation with slides. The evaluation leader recapitulates the
 steps of the ATAM and all the information collected in the steps of the
 method, including the business context, driving requirements, 
constraints, and architecture. Then the following outputs are presented:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The architectural approaches documented</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The set of scenarios and their prioritization from the brainstorming</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The utility tree</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The risks discovered</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The nonrisks documented</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• The sensitivity points and tradeoff points found</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Risk themes and the business drivers threatened by each one</p>
<div class="sidebar"><a id="page_412"></a><hr>
<p class="title"><a id="ch21sb02"></a>“. . . but it was OK.”</p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Years of experience have taught us that no 
architecture evaluation exercise ever goes completely by the book. And 
yet for all the ways that an exercise might go terribly wrong, for all 
the details that can be overlooked, for all the fragile egos that can be
 bruised, and for all the high stakes that are on the table, we have 
never had an architecture evaluation exercise spiral out of control. 
Every single one has been a success, as measured by the feedback we 
gather from clients.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">While they all turned out successfully, there were a few memorable cliffhangers.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">More than once, we began an architecture evaluation
 only to discover that the development organization had no architecture 
to be evaluated. Sometimes there was a stack of class diagrams or vague 
text descriptions masquerading as an architecture. Once we were promised
 that the architecture would be ready by the time the exercise began, 
but in spite of good intentions, it wasn’t. (We weren’t always so 
prudent about pre-exercise preparation and qualification. Our current 
diligence was a result of experiences like these.) But it was OK. In 
cases like these, the evaluation’s main results included the articulated
 set of quality attributes, a “whiteboard” architecture sketched during 
the exercise, plus a set of documentation obligations on the architect. 
In all cases, the client felt that the detailed scenarios, the analysis 
we were able to perform on the elicited architecture, plus the 
recognition of what needed to be done, more than justified the exercise.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">A couple of times we began an evaluation only to 
lose the architect in the middle of the exercise. In one case, the 
architect resigned between preparation and execution of the evaluation. 
This was an organization in turmoil and the architect simply got a 
better offer in a calmer environment elsewhere. Normally we don’t 
proceed without the architect, but it was OK. In this case the 
architect’s apprentice stepped in. A little additional prework to 
prepare him, and we were all set. The evaluation went off as planned, 
and the preparation that the apprentice did for the exercise helped 
mightily to prepare him to step into the architect’s shoes.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Once we discovered halfway through an ATAM exercise
 that the architecture we had prepared to evaluate was being jettisoned 
in favor of a new one that nobody had bothered to mention. During step 6
 of phase 1, the architect responded to a problem raised by a scenario 
by casually mentioning that “the new architecture” would not suffer from
 that deficiency. Everyone in the room, stakeholders and evaluators 
alike, looked at each other in the puzzled silence that followed. “What 
new architecture?” I asked blankly, and out it came. The developing 
organization (a contractor for the U.S. military, which had commissioned
 the evaluation), had prepared a new architecture for the system, to 
handle the more stringent requirements they knew were coming in the 
future. We called a timeout, conferred with the architect and the 
client, and decided to continue the exercise using the new architecture 
as the subject instead of the old. We backed up to step 3 (the 
architecture presentation), but everything else on the table—business 
drivers, utility <a id="page_413"></a>tree, scenarios—still were 
completely valid. The evaluation proceeded as before, and at the 
conclusion of the exercise our military client was extremely pleased at 
the knowledge gained.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">In perhaps the most bizarre evaluation in our 
experience, we lost the architect midway through phase 2. The client for
 this exercise was the project manager in an organization undergoing a 
massive restructuring. The manager was a pleasant gentleman with a quick
 sense of humor, but there was an undercurrent about him that said he 
was not to be crossed. The architect was being reassigned to a different
 part of the organization in the near future; this was tantamount to 
being fired from the project, and the manager said he wanted to 
establish the quality of the architecture before his architect’s awkward
 departure. (We didn’t find any of this out until after the evaluation.)
 When we set up the ATAM exercise, the manager suggested that the junior
 designers attend. “They might learn something,” he said. We agreed. As 
the exercise began, our schedule (which was very tight to begin with) 
kept being disrupted. The manager wanted us to meet with his company’s 
executives. Then he wanted us to have a long lunch with someone who 
could, he said, give us more architectural insights. The executives, it 
turned out, were busy just now, and so could we come back and meet with 
them a bit later? By now, phase 2 was thrown off schedule by so much 
that the architect, to our horror, had to leave to fly back to his home 
in a distant city. He was none too happy that his architecture was going
 to be evaluated without him. The junior designers, he said, would never
 be able to answer our questions. Before his departure, our team 
huddled. The exercise seemed to be teetering on the brink of disaster. 
We had an unhappy departing architect, a blown schedule, and 
questionable expertise available. We decided to split our evaluation 
team. One half of the team would continue with phase 2 using the junior 
designers as our information resource. The second half of the team would
 continue with phase 2 by telephone the next day with the architect. 
Somehow we would make the best of a bad situation.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Surprisingly, the project manager seemed completely
 unperturbed by the turn of events. “It will work out, I’m sure,” he 
said pleasantly, and then retreated to confer with various vice 
presidents about the reorganization.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">I led the team interviewing the junior designers. 
We had never gotten a completely satisfactory architecture presentation 
from the architect. Discrepancies in the documentation were met with a 
breezy “Oh, well, that’s not how it really works.” So I decided to start
 over with ATAM step 3. We asked the half dozen or so designers what 
their view of the architecture was. “Could you draw it?” I asked them. 
They looked at each other nervously, but one said, “I think I can draw 
part of it.” He took to the whiteboard and drew a very reasonable 
component-and-connector view. Someone else volunteered to draw a process
 view. A third person drew the architecture for an important offline 
part of the system. Others jumped in to assist.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">As we looked around the room, everyone was busy 
transcribing the whiteboard pictures. None of the pictures corresponded 
to anything we had seen in the documentation so far. “Are these diagrams
 documented <a id="page_414"></a>anywhere?” I asked. One of the designers looked up from his busy scribbling for a moment to grin. “They are now,” he said.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">As we proceeded to step 8, analyzing the 
architecture using the scenarios previously captured, the designers did 
an astonishingly good job of working together to answer our questions. 
Nobody knew everything, but everybody knew something. Together in a half
 day, they produced a clear and consistent picture of the whole 
architecture that was much more coherent and understandable than 
anything the architect had been willing to produce in two whole days of 
pre-exercise discussion. And by the end of phase 2, the design team was 
transformed. This erstwhile group of information-starved individuals 
with limited compartmentalized knowledge became a true architecture 
team. The members drew out and recognized each others’ expertise. This 
expertise was revealed and validated in front of everyone—and most 
important, in front of their project manager, who had slipped back into 
the room to observe. There was a look of supreme satisfaction on his 
face. It began to dawn on me that—you guessed it—it was OK.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">It turned out that this project manager knew how to
 manipulate events and people in ways that would have impressed 
Machiavelli. The architect’s departure was not because of the 
reorganization, but merely coincident with it. The project manager had 
orchestrated it. The architect had, the manager felt, become too 
autocratic and dictatorial, and the manager wanted the junior design 
staff to be given the opportunity to mature and contribute. The 
architect’s mid-exercise departure was exactly what the project manager 
had wanted. And the design team’s emergence under fire had been the 
primary purpose of the evaluation exercise all along. Although we found 
several important issues related to the architecture, the project 
manager knew about every one of them before we ever arrived. In fact, he
 made sure we uncovered some of them by a few discreet remarks during 
breaks or after a day’s session.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Was this exercise a success? The client could not 
have been more pleased. His instincts about the architecture’s strengths
 and weaknesses were confirmed. We were instrumental in helping his 
design team, which would guide the system through the stormy seas of the
 company’s reorganization, come together as an effective and cohesive 
unit at exactly the right time. And the client was so pleased with our 
final report that he made sure the company’s board of directors saw it.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">These cliffhangers certainly stand out in our 
memory. There was no architecture documented. But it was OK. It wasn’t 
the right architecture. But it was OK. There was no architect. But it 
was OK. The client really only wanted to effect a team reorganization. 
In every instance we reacted as reasonably as we could, and each time it
 was OK.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Why? Why, time after time, does it turn out OK? I think there are three reasons.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">First, the people who have commissioned the 
architecture evaluation really want it to succeed. The architect, 
developers, and stakeholders <a id="page_415"></a>assembled at the 
client’s behest also want it to succeed. As a group, they help to keep 
the exercise marching toward the goal of architectural insight. Second, 
we are always honest. If we feel that the exercise is derailing, we call
 a timeout and confer among ourselves, and usually confer with the 
client. While a small amount of bravado can come in handy during an 
exercise, we never, ever try to bluff our way through an evaluation. 
Participants can detect that instinctively, and the evaluation team must
 never lose the respect of the other participants. Third, the methods 
are constructed to establish and maintain a steady consensus throughout 
the exercise. There are no surprises at the end. The participants lay 
down the ground rules for what constitutes a suitable architecture, and 
they contribute to the risks uncovered at every step of the way.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">So: Do the best job you can. Be honest. Trust the 
methods. Trust in the goodwill and good intentions of the people you 
have assembled. And it will be OK. (Adapted from <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/app01.html#bib01_049">[Clements 01b]</a>)</p>

<h3 id="ch21lev1sec3">21.3. Lightweight Architecture Evaluation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Although we attempt to use time in an ATAM exercise 
as efficiently as possible, it remains a substantial undertaking. It 
requires some 20 to 30 person-days of effort from an evaluation team, 
plus even more for the architect and stakeholders. Investing this amount
 of time only makes sense on a large and costly project, where the risks
 of making a major mistake in the architecture are unacceptable.</p>
<p class="indent">For this reason, we have developed a Lightweight 
Architecture Evaluation method, based on the ATAM, for smaller, less 
risky projects. A Lightweight Architecture Evaluation exercise may take 
place in a single day, or even a half-day meeting. It may be carried out
 entirely by members internal to the organization. Of course this lower 
level of scrutiny and objectivity may not probe the architecture as 
deeply, but this is a cost/benefit tradeoff that is entirely appropriate
 for many projects.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the participants are all internal to the 
organization and fewer in number than for the ATAM, giving everyone 
their say and achieving a shared understanding takes much less time. 
Hence the steps and phases of a Lightweight Architecture Evaluation can 
be carried out more quickly. A suggested schedule for phases 1 and 2 is 
shown in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch21.html#ch21tab04">Table 21.4</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">There is no final report, but (as in the regular ATAM)
 a scribe is responsible for capturing results, which can then be 
distributed and serve as the basis for risk remediation.</p>
<p class="indent">An entire Lightweight Architecture Evaluation can be 
prosecuted in less than a day—perhaps an afternoon. The results will 
depend on how well the assembled team understands the goals of the 
method, the techniques of the method, and the system itself. The 
evaluation team, being internal, is typically <em>not</em> objective, and this may compromise the value of its results—one tends to hear fewer new ideas <a id="page_417"></a>and
 fewer dissenting opinions. But this version of evaluation is 
inexpensive, easy to convene, and relatively low ceremony, so it can be 
quickly deployed whenever a project wants an architecture quality 
assurance sanity check.</p>
<h3 id="ch21lev1sec4">21.4. Summary</h3>
<p class="noindent">If a system is important enough for you to explicitly design its architecture, then that architecture should be evaluated.</p>
<p class="indent">The number of evaluations and the extent of each 
evaluation may vary from project to project. A designer should perform 
an evaluation during the process of making an important decision. 
Lightweight evaluations can be performed several times during a project 
as a peer review exercise.</p>
<p class="indent">The ATAM is a comprehensive method for evaluating 
software architectures. It works by having project decision makers and 
stakeholders articulate a precise list of quality attribute requirements
 (in the form of scenarios) and by illuminating the architectural 
decisions relevant to carrying out each high-priority scenario. The 
decisions can then be understood in terms of risks or nonrisks to find 
any trouble spots in the architecture.</p>
<p class="indent">Lightweight Architecture Evaluation, based on the 
ATAM, provides an inexpensive, low-ceremony architecture evaluation that
 can be carried out in an afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="ch21lev1sec6"><a id="page_418"></a>21.6. Discussion Questions</h3>
<p class="question"><strong>1.</strong> Think of a software system that you’re working on. Prepare a 30-minute presentation on the business drivers for this system.</p>
<p class="question"><strong>2.</strong> If you were going to evaluate 
the architecture for this system, who would you want to participate? 
What would be the stakeholder roles and who could you get to represent 
those roles?</p>
<p class="question"><strong>3.</strong> Use the utility tree that you wrote for the ATM in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch16.html#ch16">Chapter 16</a> and the design that you sketched for the ATM in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/ch17.html#ch17">Chapter 17</a>
 to perform the scenario analysis step of the ATAM. Capture any risks 
and nonrisks that you discover. Better yet, perform the analysis on the 
design carried out by a colleague.</p>
<p class="question"><strong>4.</strong> It is not uncommon for an 
organization to evaluate two competing architectures. How would you 
modify the ATAM to produce a quantitative output that facilitates this 
comparison?</p>
<p class="question"><strong>5.</strong> Suppose you’ve been asked to 
evaluate the architecture for a system in confidence. The architect 
isn’t available. You aren’t allowed to discuss the evaluation with any 
of the system’s stakeholders. How would you proceed?</p>
<p class="question"><strong>6.</strong> Under what circumstances would 
you want to employ a full-strength ATAM and under what circumstances 
would you want to employ a Lightweight Architecture Evaluation?</p>
